Compositions that, like 4′33″, include no sounds produced by the performer, were conceived by a number of composers and writers before Cage. Examples include the following:

Alphonse Allais's 1897 Funeral March for the Obsequies of a Deaf Man, consisting of twenty-four blank measures.[18] Allais was an associate of Erik Satie, and given Cage's profound admiration for Satie, it is possible that Cage was inspired by the Funeral March. When asked, Cage claimed he was unaware of Allais's composition at the time.[19]
In Gaston Leroux's 1903 novel La Double Vie de Théophraste Longuet [fr], silent concerts are given by the fictional Talpa people[20] who dwell in the dark and silent Catacombs of Paris.
Erwin Schulhoff's 1919 "In futurum", a movement from the Fünf Pittoresken for piano. The Czech composer's meticulously notated composition is made up entirely of rests.[21]
In Harold Acton's 1928 book Cornelian a musician conducts "performances consisting largely of silence".[22]
In 1947, jazz musician Dave Tough joked that he was writing a play in which "A string quartet is playing the most advanced music ever written. It's made up entirely of rests. ... Suddenly, the viola man jumps up in a rage and shakes his bow at the first violin. 'Lout', he screams, 'you played that last measure wrong.'"[23]
Yves Klein's 1949 Monotone-Silence Symphony (informally The Monotone Symphony, conceived 1947–48), an orchestral forty-minute piece whose second and final movement is a twenty-minute silence[24] (the first movement being an unvarying twenty minute drone).
