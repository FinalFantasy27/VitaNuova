15.
The first thing to note, as we approach ontological issues is that there are two ways in which one can express this historical fact about Socrates:

(1) by a simple subject-predicate sentence (with an adverbial modifier),
ran
Socrates runs at t
will run
(2) by a counterpart sentence, the subject of which is an event expression
A running by Socrates at t	took place
is taking place
will take place
How is the connection between these two locutions to be understood?
16. I propose to construe this relationship as akin to that between

(3) Snow is white
and
(4) Being white is exemplified by snow
and to apply to (2) the type of analysis I have given of (4).
