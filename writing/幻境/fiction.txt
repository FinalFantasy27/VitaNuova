as we can see in Azzouni (2004), reference need not require existence of
the objects that are referred to.

Oxford University Press.

The fictionalist’s proposal is to extend to mathematics the work on the
nature of fictional characters that Amie Thomasson has developed (1999).
Thomasson put forward the artifact theory of fictional objects, according
to which the latter objects are abstract artifacts. First, fictional objects are
created by the intentional acts of their authors (in this sense, they are arti
facts).
So, they are introduced in a particular context, in a particular time.
Second, fictional objects depend on (i) the existence of copies of the art
works
that describe these objects (or through memories of such works), and
(ii) the existence of a community who is able to understand these works. In
other words, fictional objects depend on the existence of concrete objects
in the physical world (e.g. books, a community of readers, etc.).
