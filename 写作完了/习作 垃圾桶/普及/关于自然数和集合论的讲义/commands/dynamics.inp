% This file is part of the lilyglyphs package %
% and defines one subset of glyphs            %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Dynamic Script letters %
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%--------------
% Single Glyphs

% The dynamics letters don't have to be accessed through special commands
% but can be written through \lilyText.
% A chain of glyphs can be printed at once, 
% normal space is possible between letters
% Available glyphs are
	% f for forte
	% p for piano
	% m for mezzo
	% r for rin-
	% s for s- (as in sf)
	% z for -z (as in sfz)

% \lilyDynamics is just a wrapper around \lilyText
% specifying a default scaling factor
\newcommand{\lilyDynamics}[2][]{%
	\setkeys{lilyDesignOptions}{scale=1.5,raise=0}%
	\lilyPrint[#1]{#2}%
}

%-------------------------
% Combined Dynamic Scripts

% Combined dynamics aren't generally necessary
% as \lilyText takes any combination of characters as argument.
% Some combinations seem to need additonal kerning,
% so we provide predefined commands for them

% rinforzando 
\newcommand{\lilyRF}[1][]{%
	\mbox{\lilyDynamics[#1]{r\hspace{0.035ex}f}}%
}
	
% rinforzando with trailing z
\newcommand{\lilyRFZ}[1][]{%
	\mbox{\lilyDynamics[#1]{r\hspace{0.035ex}fz}}%
}
