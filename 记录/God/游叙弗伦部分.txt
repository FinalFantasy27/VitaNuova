The Euthyphro dilemma is found in Plato's dialogue Euthyphro, in which Socrates asks Euthyphro, "Is the pious (τὸ ὅσιον) loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?" (10a)
Gottfried Leibniz asked whether the good and just "is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just".
 G.W. Leibniz stated, in Reflections on the Common Concept of Justice (circa 1702): "It is generally agreed that whatever God wills is good and just. But there remains the question whether it is good and just because God wills it or whether God wills it because it is good and just; in other words, whether justice and Goodness are arbitrary or whether they belong to the necessary and eternal truths about the nature of things."

Aquinas draws a distinction between what is good or evil in itself and what is good or evil because of God's commands
Aquinas c. 1265–1274Aquinas, Thomas (1265–1274). Summa Theologica., 2a2ae 57.2

Thus he contends that not even God can change the Ten Commandments (adding, however, that God can change what individuals deserve in particular cases, in what might look like special dispensations to murder or stealing).
Aquinas c. 1265–1274, 1a2ae 100.8
