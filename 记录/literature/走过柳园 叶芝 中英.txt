DOWN BY THE SALLEY GARDENS
　　
　　Down by the salley gardens my love and I did meet;
　　She passed the salley gardens with little snow-white feet.
　　She bid me take love easy, as the leaves grow on the tree;
　　But I, being young and foolish, with her would not agree.
　　
　　In a field by the river my love and I did stand,
　　And on my leaning shoulder she laid her snow-white hand.
　　She bid me take life easy, as the grass grows on the weirs;
　　But I was young and foolish, and now am full of tears.


走过柳园 

走过柳园，我遇见我的爱 
她正穿过柳园，纤足雪白 
她要我自然地相爱，像树木长出叶子 
但我年轻而愚蠢，和她意见不一 

河边田野，我的爱站我身边 
她雪白的小手，放我斜肩 
她要我自然地生活，像青草生于堤坝 
但我年轻而愚蠢，如今空把泪洒
