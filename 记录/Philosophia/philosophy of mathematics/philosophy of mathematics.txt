Field's epistemological problem
Field himself then suggests a considerable further reduction of the problem: he does not question the explicability of the reliability of judgements about what follows logically or analytically from what. Thus whatever area is considered, the issue is not really about the reliability of arbitrary beliefs within that area, but rather about axiomatic beliefs, ones that are not believed simply because they follow logically or analytically from other, more basic beliefs. The challenge is thus to explain the reliability of axiomatic beliefs in set theory, to explain the correlation between axioms of standard set theory being believed and their being true.

Maddy's modified indispensibility argument
The idea is that although it is physics that leads to our commitment to some mathematics, once we have a commitment to mathematics that commitment can be expanded using techniques internal to the development of mathematics: not every piece of acceptable mathematics needs to be directly tied to physics. Thus, according to the modified indispensability argument [Mad92, p. 280], "the calculus is indispensable in physics; the set-theoretic continuum provides our best account of the calculus; indispensability thus justifies our belief in the set-theoretic continuum, and so, in the set-theoretic methods that generate it; examined and extended in mathematically justifiable ways, this yields Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory."

In a series of papers, Charles Parsons (Parsons 1964, 1969, 1984) has argued that the syntheticity of mathematical judgments depends on mathematical intuitions being fundamentally immediate, and he explains the immediacy of such representations in a perceptual way, as a direct, phenomenological presence to the mind
