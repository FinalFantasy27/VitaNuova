Shapiro was unmoved by Quine's argument [Qui70, p. 66] that second
order logic is "set theory in sheep's clothing." He accepted that second-order
logic is nothing more than a fancy way of quantifying over all subsets of a
domain. He granted Quine's conclusion that second-order logic and set the
ory are intimately connected, but he rejected the implication that that some
how renders second-order logic unfit to serve as logic. He outdid Quine in
his antifoundationalism by denying that there is anything special about logic
that requires that it be free of substantial mathematical commitments. If logic
were to be in some sense prior to mathematics, that would be necessary. But,
for Shapiro, the logical foundations of mathematics are just more mathemat
ics. (See [Sha91, p. 97].)
