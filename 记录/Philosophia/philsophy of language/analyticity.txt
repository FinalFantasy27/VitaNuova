卡尔纳普的分析概念，就是“可以只从逻辑中得出”，考虑到他有所谓“宽容原则”，可以随时改变元逻辑立场（事实上，他就是这样来应对哥德尔用他的定理的批评的）；而且在卡尔纳普关于奎因的记录中（在蒯因发表两个教条的20年前），他就知道了蒯因的观点，而且表现出了赞同蒯因的倾向（分析/综合或许只是权宜之计，蒯因很可能是对的…）

e.g. experimental philosophy found significant cultural differences between responses of Asian and Western students regarding whether someone counted as having knowledge in a standard “Gettier” (1963) example of accidental justified true belief

externalism: putnam (1962 [1975], 1965 [1975] and 1975), Kripke (1972 [1980]) and Burge (1979, 1986), but it took the form of positive theories in, e.g., the work of Devitt (1981, 2015), Dretske (1988) and Fodor (1990b),Millikan, 1984), Papineau, 1987, and Neander, 1995, 2017 who look to mechanisms of natural selection(Teleological Theories of Mental Content)

Internal Dependencies  “basic explanatory role”  (Horwich, 1998:45,129; see also Devitt 1996, 2002 for a similar proposal)
