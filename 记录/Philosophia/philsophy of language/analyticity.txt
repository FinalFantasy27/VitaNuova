Kant
Philosophy confines itself to universal concepts; mathematics can achieve nothing by concepts alone but hastens at once to intuition, in which it considers the concept in concreto, though not empirically, but only in an intuition which it presents a priori, that is, which it has constructed, and in which whatever follows from the universal conditions of the construction must be universally valid of the object thus constructed.
—(Kant, Critique of Pure Reason A716/B744)

For Kant, the concept of the number 7 is available to the Understanding without the aid of Sensibility and, hence, without intuitions. But its schematization—the provision of a reference for any concept-expression associated with it—does require intuition.

弗雷格对“分析”的定义：

If the proof relies only on “general logical laws and definitions,” then the proposition is analytic. But if the proof requires assumptions that “belong instead to the domain of a particular science, then the proposition is synthetic”

弗雷格认为这是康德心中真正所想的

Philosophy of MathematicsLinnebo, OysteinPrinceton University Press2017

罗素在分析/综合的立场上及其诡异，一会儿说数学是先验综合的，一会儿说数学是先验分析的。罗素在早期曾赞同康德“先验综合”的说法；但是他反康德是出了名的，而且他是逻辑主义的代表人物，自然被视作“先验分析”派。一种解释是他在说是分析时，是说数学可以只从逻辑中推出来而无需其它；而他在说综合时，值得注意的是罗素和康德不同，他不但说数学是先验综合的，还说逻辑是先验综合的，或许他是在“分析主词时得不到属性”这一意义上来说的，根据庞加莱的证言，罗素不认为逻辑是空洞的，不增加知识；卡尔纳普的分析概念，就是“可以只从逻辑中得出”，考虑到他有所谓“宽容原则”，可以随时改变元逻辑立场（事实上，他就是这样来应对哥德尔用他的定理的批评的）；而且在卡尔纳普关于奎因的记录中（在蒯因发表两个教条的20年前），他就知道了蒯因的观点，而且表现出了赞同蒯因的倾向（分析/综合或许只是权宜之计，蒯因很可能是对的…）

The Quinean reply: how in the end are we to distinguish such claims of “rational insight,” “primitive compulsion,” inferential practices or folk beliefs, from merely some deeply entrenched empirical convictions, folk practices or, indeed, from mere dogmas? 
e.g. experimental philosophy found significant cultural differences between responses of Asian and Western students regarding whether someone counted as having knowledge in a standard “Gettier” (1963) example of accidental justified true belief

externalism: putnam (1962 [1975], 1965 [1975] and 1975), Kripke (1972 [1980]) and Burge (1979, 1986), but it took the form of positive theories in, e.g., the work of Devitt (1981, 2015), Dretske (1988) and Fodor (1990b),Millikan, 1984), Papineau, 1987, and Neander, 1995, 2017 who look to mechanisms of natural selection(Teleological Theories of Mental Content)
