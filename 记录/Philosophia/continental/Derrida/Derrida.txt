he refers to traditional metaphysics as ‘the metaphysics of presence’ (e.g. ‘Structure’, p. 281).

Now by ‘speech’ Derrida intends exercise of direct marks. By ‘writing’ he intends, among other things – the reason for this qualificatio will become apparent in due course – exercise of indirect marks.

By contrast the sense that is made of things in writing depends on what is absent from consciousness when the sense-making is present to consciousness: it depends on relations between itself and other, distinct entities.

The very idea of a direct mark is an anathema to him. (See esp. Speech and Phenomena, passim. There can be no such)27 thing as speech.

Meaning, on Derrida’s view, is determined by the repeated use of signs in writing. It is also, we now see, given by the use of signs in writing – in the sense illustrated in the previous paragraph. This in turn means that it is given by a kind of perpetual deferral: the connection of any given sign with what it represents is given through its connection with other signs, whose connection with what they represent is given through their connec tion with other signs, whose connection with what they represent is given through their connection with other signs, and so on indefinitely (see e.g. Grammatology, Pt I, Ch. 1, passim).

The French verb ‘diffe/rer’ can be translated either as ‘to differ’ or as ‘to defer’. The noun ‘diffe/rence’, with an ‘e’, corresponds to only one of these. It can be translated as ‘difference’ but not as ‘deferral’. Derrida wants a noun that does double duty
