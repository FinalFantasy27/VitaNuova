 abstraction principles, which are used for supplying abstract objects with criteria of identity. The idea of this method of characterizing abstract objects is also largely due to Frege, who wrote:

If the symbol a is to designate an object for us, then we must have a criterion that decides in all cases whether b is the same as a, even if it is not always in our power to apply this criterion. (Frege 1884, trans. Beaney 1997: 109)
