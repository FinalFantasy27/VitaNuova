According to a common view, abstract entities lack spatio-temporal properties and relations, as opposed to concrete objects which exist in space and time (Lowe 1995: 515).
Lowe, Jonathan, 1995, “The metaphysics of abstract objects”, The Journal of Philosophy, 92: 509–524.
another requirement often imposed upon abstract objects, namely the one of a causal inefficacy (see, e.g., Grossmann 1992: 7).

Goodman and Quine (1947) tie the notion of abstractness to the notion of spatiotemporal location, but, after Benacerraf (1973), discussions about abstracta regularly focus on causal notions in characterizing the abstract–concrete distinction.
