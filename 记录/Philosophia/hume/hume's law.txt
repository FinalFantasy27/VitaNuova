Treatise:
In every system of morality, which I have hitherto met with, I have always
remark’d, that the author proceeds for some time in the ordinary way of reasoning,
and establishes the being of a God, or makes observations concerning
human affairs; when of a sudden I am surpriz’d to find, that instead of the usual
copulations of propositions, is, and is not, I meet with no proposition that is
not connected with an ought, or an ought not. This change is imperceptible; but
is, however, of the last consequence. For as this ought, or ought not, expresses
some new relation or affirmation, ’tis necessary that it shou’d be observ’d and
explain’d; and at the same time that a reason should be given, for what seems
altogether inconceivable, how this new relation can be a deduction from others,
which are entirely different from it [14, 3.1.1].
