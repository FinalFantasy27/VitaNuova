属加种差定义
 in Metaphysics (998b22), Aristotle argues explicitly that there cannot be a highest genus (e.g., of being or unity) shared by entities of different categories (cf. Ackrill 1963, 81). For a species is defined in terms of its subsuming genus and differentia (e.g., man is definable as an animal that is rational), and while the genus (animal) may be predicated of the species (man), it may not be predicated of the differentia (rational). As a result, if being (or unity) were a genus, no differentiae could be said to have being (or to be one); but “the differentiae of any genus must each of them both have being and be one” (Metaphysics 998b22–3).

the ten highest categories of things “said without any combination” (Categories 1b25):

Substance (e.g., man, horse)
Quantity (e.g., four-foot, five-foot)
Quality (e.g., white, grammatical)
Relation (e.g., double, half)
Place (e.g., in the Lyceum, in the market-place)
Date (e.g., yesterday, last year)
Posture (e.g., is lying, is sitting)
State (e.g., has shoes on, has armor on)
Action (e.g., cutting, burning)
Passion (e.g., being cut, being burned)

第一实体和第二实体
There are two sorts of substance: a primary substance is, e.g., an individual man or horse; the species (and genera) of these individuals (e.g., man, animal) are secondary substances. While the ten categories are all equally highest kinds, primary substances nonetheless have a certain sort of priority, since “all the other things are either said of the primary substances as subjects or in them as subjects. So if the primary substances did not exist it would be impossible for any of the other things to exist” (Categories 2b4).

亚里士多德的实体（ουσια）范畴内的词项
我们不妨先区分两种谓词或普遍词项。一种叫种类词，即亚里士多德的实体（ουσια）范畴内的词项。包括“人” 、“狗”、“南瓜”、“外衣”、“岛”等等，以及更普遍的词项“生物”、“物体”等等，其所以在逻辑上自成一类，靠的是一个特点：种类词“iota”的涵义、意义、内涵、内包、“语义解释”的一部分就在于，凡是iota者在其整个存在期内曾经一直是iota也将要永远是iota。另一种叫非种类词，即质、行为、爱好等范畴内的词项，包括“白”、“诚实”、“管子工”等等，它们没有“分析的永久性”这一特点。（p204-5）
