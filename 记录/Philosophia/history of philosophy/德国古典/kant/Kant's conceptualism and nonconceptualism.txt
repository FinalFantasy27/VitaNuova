One of the best-known and most widely-quoted texts of the Critique of Pure Reason is this pithy slogan: “thoughts without content are empty, intuitions without concepts are blind” (A51/B76). That slogan encapsulates what can be called the togetherness principle.

What does the togetherness principle mean? The famous texts just quoted have led many readers and interpreters of Kant—e.g., Sellars 1963, Sellars 1968, McDowell 1994, and Abela 2002—to deny the cognitive and semantic independence of intuitions: intuitions without concepts either simply do not exist or else are wholly meaningless (i.e., neither objectively valid nor rationally intelligible) even if they do exist. And this denial appears to be supported by at least one other text:

The understanding cognizes everything only through concepts; consequently, however far it goes in its divisions [of lower concepts] it never cognizes through mere intuition but always yet again through lower concepts. (A656/B684).
But even so, this cannot be a correct interpretation of the famous texts at A50–51/B74–76, because of what Kant says in these texts:

Objects can indeed appear to us without necessarily having to be related to functions of the understanding. (A89/B122, emphasis added)
Appearances can certainly be given in intuition without functions of the understanding. (A90/B122, emphasis added)
Appearances might very well be so constituted that the understanding would not find them in accordance with the conditions of its unity…. [and] in the series of appearances nothing would present itself that would yield a rule of synthesis and so correspond to the concept of cause and effect, so that this concept would be entirely empty, null, and meaningless. Appearances would none the less present objects to our intuition, since intuition by no means requires the functions of thought. (A90–91/B122–123, emphasis added)
The manifold for intuition must already be given prior to the synthesis of the understanding and independently from it. (B145, emphasis added)

Unfortunately, even quite apart from their Kantian incarnations, conceptualism and non-conceptualism are defined in non-trivially different ways by different contemporary philosophers of mind (see, e.g., Bermúdez & Cahen 2015, Van Cleve 2012). But for the present purposes of discussion, conceptualism is the two-part thesis (C1) that all rational human conscious objective representational content is strictly determined by conceptual capacities alone, and (C2) that non-rational human or non-human animals are not capable of conscious objective representation. By contrast, non-conceptualism is the three-part thesis (NC1) that not all rational human conscious objective representational content is determined by conceptual capacities alone, (NC2) that at least some rational human conscious objective representational contents are both autonomous from and independent of conceptual content and also strictly determined by non-conceptual capacities alone, and (NC3) that at least some and perhaps most non-rational human or non-human animals are capable of conscious objective representation.

Kant’s conceptualism, in turn, is taken to follow directly from the togetherness principle; and, in addition to asserting both (C1) and (C2), it adds either (KC1) that the rational human understanding and its innate conceptual capacities not only strictly determine all conscious objective representational content, especially including all objectively valid judgments, but also strictly determine the faculty of sensibility itself and all the intuitions yielded by it (strong Kantian conceptualism) (see, e.g., Sellars 1963, Sellars 1968, McDowell 1994, Abela 2002), or else (KC2) that the rational human understanding and its innate conceptual capacities strictly determine all conscious objective representational content, especially including all objectively valid judgments, as well as all intuitions, although the faculty of sensibility independently provides a necessary condition for conscious objective representation, and some empirical concepts or conceptual activities occur outside the context of fully explicit judgments or self-consciously articulated propositions (weak Kantian conceptualism) (see, e.g., Wenzel 2005, Ginsborg 2006, Ginsborg 2008, McDowell 2009, Bowman 2011, Grüne 2009, Griffith 2012, Land 2011, Bauer 2012, Golob 2012, Williams 2012, McDowell 2013, Pippin 2013, McLear 2014, Land 2016, Soboleva forthcoming, Golob forthcoming). The most important difference between strong Kantian conceptualism and weak Kantian conceptualism is that whereas the weak variety at least minimally preserves Kant’s cognitive dualism of faculties, and also some sort of semi-independent cognitive role for intuitions (even though it still rejects the thesis that intuitions have an essentially different kind of representational content from concepts), the strong variety does not countenance any of these concessions to non-conceptualism, and thereby, in effect, strong Kantian conceptualism explanatorily reduces the faculty of sensibility to the faculty of understanding.

In any case, by contrast to either weak or strong Kantian conceptualism, Kant’s non-conceptualism is taken to follow from the four texts cited above; and in addition to asserting (NC1), (NC2), and (NC3), it also adds either (KNC1) that the rational human capacity for sensibility generates empirical intuitions and pure intuitions that autonomously and independently provide conscious objective representational contents (weak Kantian non-conceptualism) (Rohs 2001, Hanna 2005, Allais 2009, Allais 2015, McLear 2015, Allais 2016), or else (KNC2) that the rational human capacity for sensibility not only generates empirical intuitions and pure intuitions that autonomously and independently provide conscious objective representational contents, but also, by means of these autonomous and independent non-conceptual cognitions, the faculty of sensibility contributes directly to the justification of epistemic and practical beliefs, by virtue of inherently normative and proto-rational factors that it builds into the essentially non-conceptual content of intuitions (strong Kantian non-conceptualism) (Laiho 2012, Tolley 2013, Hanna 2015). The most important difference between weak Kantian non-conceptualism and strong Kantian non-conceptualism is that whereas the weak variety does not directly address the classical Sellarsian worry, known as The Myth of the Given, that nothing can count as conscious objective representational content unless it occurs within the essentially conceptual domain of “the space of reasons” (see, e.g., Sellars 1963, McDowell 1994, McDowell 2009), and only thereby can contribute directly to the justification of epistemic and practical beliefs, the strong version of Kantian non-conceptualism explicitly asserts that autonomously and independently objectively valid intuitions can contribute directly to the justification of epistemic and practical beliefs without having to enter the essentially conceptual domain of “the space of reasons.” Or in other words, strong Kantian non-conceptualism explicitly deflects and trumps The Myth of the Given.
