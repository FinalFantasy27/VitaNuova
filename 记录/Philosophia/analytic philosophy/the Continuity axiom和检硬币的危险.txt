Axiom 3 (Continuity)
Suppose A ⪯ B ⪯ C. Then there is a p ∈ [0, 1] such that: {pA, (1−p)C} ∼ B
Axiom 4 (Independence)
Suppose A ⪯ B. Then for any C, and any p ∈ [0, 1]: {pA, (1−p)C} ⪯ {pB, (1−p)C}Continuity implies that no outcome A is so bad that you would not be willing to take some gamble that might result in you ending up with that outcome, but might otherwise result in you ending up with an outcome (C) that you find to be a marginal improvement on your status quo (B), provided that the chance of A is small enough. Intuitively, Continuity guarantees that an agent’s evaluations of lotteries are appropriately sensitive to the probabilities of the lotteries’ prizes.

Independence implies that when two alternatives have the same probability for some particular outcome, our evaluation of the two alternatives should be independent of our opinion of that outcome. Intuitively, this means that preferences between lotteries should be governed only by the features of the lotteries that differ; the commonalities between the lotteries should be effectively ignored.

Some people find the Continuity axiom an unreasonable constraint on rational preference. Is there any probability p such that you would be willing to accept a gamble that has that probability of you losing your life and probability (1−p) of you gaining $10? Many people think there is not. However, the very same people would presumably cross the street to pick up a $10 bill they had dropped. But that is just taking a gamble that has a very small probability of being killed by a car but a much higher probability of gaining $10! More generally, although people rarely think of it this way, they constantly take gambles that have minuscule chances of leading to imminent death, and correspondingly very high chances of some modest reward.
