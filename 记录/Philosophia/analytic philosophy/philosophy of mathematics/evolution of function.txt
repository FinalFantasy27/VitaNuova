In 1700-1800s, there were debates on what function is, everyone agrees that f(x) = x^2 + 3x is a function, but for things like nowhere continuous function, there is doubt (Luzin.)

In his treatment of the wave equation, D' Alembert required the initial shape of a vibrating string to be given by an analytic expression (so as to be twice differentiable), but Euler insisted that functions should not be limited in this way, because the most common initial conditions - for example, a plucked string - do not satisfy this requirement. The result was a major revision of the notion of function, a firm push toward the modern set-theoretic conception. See Maddy (1997, pp. 116-123) for discussion and references.
