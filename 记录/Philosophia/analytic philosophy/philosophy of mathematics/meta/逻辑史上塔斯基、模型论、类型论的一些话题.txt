In RobertVaught’s valuable survey (1974) of model theory before 1945, he points out that Skolem,for example, worked comfortably with the notion of truth in a model, though--by contrast--uncertainly with the notion of proof, and the latter is a principal reason that he missed 10establishing the completeness theorem for first-order logic.

More generally, according to
Vaught (op.cit., p.161), since the notion of truth of a first-order sentence σ in a structure
 delta “is highly intuitive (and perfectly clear for any definite σ), it had been possible to go even
as far as the completeness theorem by treating truth (consciously or unconsciously)essentially as an undefined notion--one with many obvious properties.” Even Tarski, asquoted in ftn.5 above, from (1931), agreed with that.

Wilfrid Hodges, “Truth in a structure” (1985/86), which beginswith an informal explanation of the current conception.Hodges then goes on to report (p.137) that:
[a] few years ago I had a disconcerting experience.I read Tarski’s famousmonograph ‘The concept of truth in formalized languages’ (1935) to see what hesays himself about the notion of truth in a structure.The notion was simply notthere.This seemed curious, so I looked in other papers of Tarski.As far as Icould discover, the notion first appears in Tarski’s address (1952) to the 1950International Congress of Mathematicians, and his paper ‘Contributions to thetheory of models I’ (1954).But even in those papers he doesn’t define it.In thefirst paper he mentions the notion only in order to explain that he won’t be needingit for the purpose in hand.In the second paper he simply says “We assume it to be
clear under what conditions a sentence is satisfied in a system.”
Hodges continues, “I believe that the first time Tarski explicitly presented the mathematicaldefinition of truth in a structure was his joint paper (1957) with Robert Vaught.” In fact,the general notion of structure for a first-order language L is already described in Tarski’s1950 ICM address, essentially as follows: a structure A is a sequence consisting of a non-
empty domain A of objects together with an assignment to each basic relation, operationand constant symbol of L of a corresponding relation between elements of A, operation onelements of A, or member of A, resp.Moreover, while Hodges is correct in saying thatthe notion of truth in a structure is not defined there, Tarski does talk of the antecedentnotion of satisfaction in a structure as if it is well understood, since he refers to the
association with each formula ϕ of the set of all sequences from A which satisfy ϕ in A 
At any rate, what is of interest, as Hodges makes clear, is that these notions of
structure, and of satisfaction and truth in a structure, do not seem to appear explicitly priorto the 1950s in Tarski’s work.This is doubly puzzling, since, as a common informalnotion, the idea of a structure being a model of a system of axioms well precedes that, andsurely goes back to the nineteenth century.Most famously in that period, one had thestunning revelation of various models for non-Euclidean geometry.Then came Dedekind’s
6characterization of the natural numbers and the real numbers, in both cases structurally asmodels, unique up to isomorphism, of suitable (second-order) axioms.That was followedby Hilbert’s model-theoretic considerations concerning his axioms for geometry.Thestructural view of mathematics took hold in the early part of the twentieth century inalgebra, analysis and topology with the formulation of axioms for groups, rings, fields,metric spaces, normed spaces, topological spaces and so on, and with the systematicexploration of their various models.Within logic, the informal concept of model has beentraced back by Scanlan (1991) to the American “postulate theorists”, launched by work ofHuntington in 1902 and Veblen in 1904; this involved, among others the concept ofconsistency in the sense of satisfiability and that of categoricity.7 Finally, it was central tothe famous theorems of Löwenheim of 1915 and Skolem in 1920 on existence of countablemodels, and of course to Gödel’s completeness theorem published in 1930
