Field's epistemological problem
Field himself then suggests a considerable further reduction of the problem: he does not question the explicability of the reliability of judgements about what follows logically or analytically from what. Thus whatever area is considered, the issue is not really about the reliability of arbitrary beliefs within that area, but rather about axiomatic beliefs, ones that are not believed simply because they follow logically or analytically from other, more basic beliefs. The challenge is thus to explain the reliability of axiomatic beliefs in set theory, to explain the correlation between axioms of standard set theory being believed and their being true.
