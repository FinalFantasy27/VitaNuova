Matters of meaning and mental content are instead what typically motivate the views at the opposite end of the spectrum. To begin with, maximalism, i.e., the abundant conception in all its glory (Bealer 1982; 1993; Carmichael 2010; Casta√±eda 1976; Jubien 1989; Lewis 1986b; Orilia 1999; Zalta 1988; Van Inwagen 2004): properties are fine-grained necessary entities that exist even if uninstantiated, or even impossible to be instantiated. In its most extreme version, maximalism adopts identity conditions that differentiate properties as much as possible, but more moderate versions can be obtained by slightly relaxing such conditions. Views of this sort are hardly concerned with physicalist constraints or the like and rather focus on the explanatory advantages of hyperintensionality. These may well go beyond the typical motivations considered above: Nolan (2014) argues that hyperintensionality is increasingly important in metaphysics in dealing with issues such as counter-possible conditionals, explanation, essences, grounding, causation, confirmation and chance.
