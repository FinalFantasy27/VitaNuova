(Important papers on the emergence of psychologism in nineteenth-century German philosophy are George 1997, Peckhaus 2006 and Stelzner 2005. The most important monograph is Beiser 2014. Gray 2008 contains many important observations on early psychologistic tendencies in mathematics and logic.)

Critics and interpreters of Mill’s philosophy of logic have been unable to reach a verdict on the question whether Mill was a psychologistic thinker. Recent work by David Godden (2005) provides a detailed explanation for this lack of agreement: Mill’s position on the relationship between (deductive) logic and psychology is “fractured”. Some elements in Mill’s thought push him towards a strongly psychologistic viewpoint, other elements pull him away from it. In other words, sometimes Mill insists that logic depends on psychology, sometimes he denies such dependence.
