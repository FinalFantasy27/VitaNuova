mathematics is more like a fable, rather than a story, like oliver twist. "Yet more imporant is the matter of application, which in literature typically takes the form of a 'message'. The fable typically though not invariably has a 'moral'" For other words, it has a normative (要求). ...

However, a question could always be asked: why is mathematics so useful? If it is just a consistent (or even not consistent) story, “真空中的无摩擦转动”, then what amounts to its applicability to the reality? Well, as far as I am concerned, one immediate reply comes as follows:
If mathematics is the product of the brain, there are so many kinds of mathematical objects, and it is not strange that some be useful to our understanding to the world. For example, group is very useful in treating symmetric things, but may not be good for other structures. So the answer is simply that it is a brute fact that some mathematical concepts could be applied to some parts of our world.
Another, maybe more sophiscated version of this answer is that, just as we may put mythological interpretation onto the world (or at least phenonmena of the world), we could use mathematical interpreatation to interpret the world. Mathematics is only an intepretation.  However, it is the hard core of our web of belief, which is so robust that we so strongly believe in its truthness. For example, for 2*5=10, consider the following scenary: 我们先看到有5对桌子，每对有两张。然后我们再一个个去数，结果发现只有9张。我们可能会想我们是数错了，或者一开始就没有5对桌子/我们一开始假设有5对桌子就是错的; Or we would think that something has been removed through the process. The only case we could not believe is that 2*5=10 is false, that 2*5=\10.
