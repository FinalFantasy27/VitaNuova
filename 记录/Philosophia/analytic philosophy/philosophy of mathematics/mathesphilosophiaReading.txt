Philosophical Issues Arising: 2, The Connections With Plural Quantification And Natural Language 
George Boolos has argued that we can “tame” second-order logic (and see it as genuinely part of logic) by interpreting second-order quantifiers as (akin to) plural quantifiers. For a basic exchange, see: 
BOOLOS, G., 'To Be Is to Be a Value of a Variable (or to Be Some Values of Some Variables)', Journal of Philosophy, 81 (1984), 430-449. Also in his Logic, Logic and Logic (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1998); and in S. Shapiro, ed., The Limits of Logic (Aldershot: Dartmouth, 1996).
