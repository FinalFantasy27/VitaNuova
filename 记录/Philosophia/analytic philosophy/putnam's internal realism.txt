putnam: 1976~1990

‘Truth’ … is some sort of (idealized) rational acceptability – some sort of ideal coherence of our beliefs with each other and with our experiences as those experiences are themselves represented in our belief system – and not correspondence with mind-independent or discourse-independent ‘states of affairs’. There is no God’s Eye point of view that we can know or usefully imagine; there are only the various points of view of actual persons reflecting various interests and purposes that their descriptions and theories subserve. (1981a: 49-50; italics in original)

The externalist (or Aristotelian/medieval/Kripkean essentialist) idea of selfidentifying objects makes no sense.7 Rather, “‘objects’ do not exist
independently of conceptual schemes. We cut up the world into objects when we introduce one or another scheme of description” (52). And there are multiple ways to do that “cutting up”: there are (at least sometimes) “equally coherent but incompatible conceptual schemes which fit our experience equally well” (73).

7 See also (1981b) and (1983a): “The idea … – i.e., that nature itself determines what our words stand for – is totally unintelligible. At bottom, to think that a sign-relation is built into nature is to revert to medieval essentialism, to the idea that there are ‘self-identifying objects’ and ‘species’ out there” (xii).

What makes a statement, or a whole system of statements – a theory or
conceptual scheme – rationally acceptable is, in large part its coherence and fit; coherence of “theoretical” of less experiential beliefs with one another and with more experiential beliefs, and also coherence of experiential beliefs with theoretical beliefs. (1981a: 54-5)
