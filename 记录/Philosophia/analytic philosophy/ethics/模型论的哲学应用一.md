Hume's thesis: no set of descriptive sentences entails a normative one

A.N. Prior (1960) takes the following to be a counterexample to Hume’s Law:

<br/>

Tea-drinking is common in England.

Tea-drinking is common in England, or all New Zealanders ought to be shot.

<br/>

if the conclusion of this argument is not normative is not, then we take it as a premise in the following argument:

<br/>

Tea-drinking is common in England, or all New Zealanders ought to be shot.

Tea-drinking is not common in England.

All New Zealanders ought to be shot.

<br/>

Instead of thinking of general sentences syntactically, as those which contain a universal quantifier, and particular sentences as those which do not, we can characterise our kinds of sentence model-theoretically.

Definition  (Genuine Particularity) A sentence is genuinely particular iff for each $M, M'$, if $M \models A$ and $M' ⊇ M$ then $M'\models A$.

A sentence is genuinely universal iff for each $M$ where $M \models A$, there is some $M' ⊇ M$ where $M \not\models A$.

Ło´s-Tarski theorem (Hodges 1997, pp. 143–146)

Theorem  (Particular/General Barrier Theorem) No satisfiable set of genuinely particular sentences entails a universal sentence.

by adding these unary tense operators to the language of a simple, truth-functional logic, 

Theorem (Past/Future Barrier Theorem) No satisfiable set of genuinely historical (or present) sentences entails a genuinely future-directed sentence.
