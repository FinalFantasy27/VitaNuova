Such sequences contain no sentence decided by the background consistent and sufficiently strong arithmetical theory. If the provability predicate satisfies the derivability conditions, each such sentence is provably equivalent to the consistency statement and to the G{\"o}del sentence. Thus each two such sentences are provably equivalent to each other. The same holds for the arithmetization of the existential Yablo paradox. We also look at a formulation which employs Rosser's provability predicate.",

We classify all subsets of the list as either consistent or inconsistent, and we measure the proof-theoretic strength of several subsets by comparing them with familiar systems of arithmetic and analysis."

    which combines elements of context dependence and hierarchy.
    This approach is developed formally, using the techniques of model theory in admissible sets.
    Special attention is paid to showing how starting with some ideas about context drawn
    from linguistics and philosophy of language, we can see the Liar sentence to be context dependent.
    Once this context dependence is properly understood,
    it is argued, a hierarchical structure emerges which is neither <I>ad hoc</I> nor unnatural.",

We find that the revision periods play a key role in characterizing the degrees of paradoxicality for Boolean paradoxes. We prove that a Boolean paradox is paradoxical in a digraph, iff this digraph contains a closed walk whose height is not any revision period of this paradox. And for any finitely many (but non-zero) numbers greater than 1, if any of them is not divisible by any other, we can construct a Boolean paradox whose primary revision periods are just these numbers. Consequently, the degrees of Boolean paradoxes form an unbounded dense lattice. The area of Boolean paradoxes is proved to be rich in mathematical structures and properties.",

%%abstract ={Tarski's theorem essentially says that the Liar paradox is paradoxical in the minimal reflexive frame. We generalize this result to the Liar-like paradox λα for all ordinal α ≥ 1. The main result is that for any positive integer n = 2i(2j +1), the paradox λn is paradoxical in a frame iff this frame contains at least a cycle the depth of which is not divisible by 2i+1; and for any ordinal α ≥ ω, the paradox λα is paradoxical in a frame iff this frame contains at least an infinite walk that has an arbitrarily large depth. We thus get that λn has a degree of paradoxicality no more than λm iff the multiplicity of 2 in the (unique) prime factorization of n is no more than that in the prime factorization of m; and all tranfinite λα has the same degree of paradoxcality but has a higher degree of paradoxicality than any λn.}, doi = {10.1093/jigpal/jzt020},

We use Solovay's method to construct paradoxes, which bear to the Solovay's sentences much the same relation as the liar paradoxbears to the G{\"o}del sentence. The main idea is to use the truth predicate instead of the provability predicate in the formalisation of the Solovay function. A typical example of such paradoxes may be seen as obtained from two ordinary paradoxes by damaging symmetry of the `baptising' biconditionals. We prove that this paradox is a proper weakening of the latter two in the sense that the former has a strictly lower degree of paradoxicality than the latter two. Solovay's method provides a new approach to finding various kinds of paradoxes.",isbn="978-981-15-7134-3"

%%%%abstract="It is widely considered that G{\"o}del's and Rosser's proofs of the incompleteness theorems are related to the Liar Paradox. Yablo's paradox, a Liar-like paradox without self-reference, can also be used to prove G{\"o}del's first and second incompleteness theorems. We show that the situation with the formalization of Yablo's paradox using Rosser's provability predicate is different from that of Rosser's proof. Namely, by using the technique of Guaspari and Solovay, we prove that the undecidability of each instance of Rosser-type formalizations of Yablo's paradox for each consistent but not $\Sigma$1-sound theory is dependent on the choice of a standard proof predicate.",issn="1573-0433",doi="10.1007/s10992-013-9309-z",url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10992-013-9309-z"

%%%%abstract="In a recent paper (Cie{\'{s}}li{\'{n}}ski and Urbaniak 2012), Urbaniak and Cie{\'{s}}li{\'{n}}ski describe an analogue of the Yablo Paradox, in the domain of formal provability. Just as the infinite sequence of Yablo sentences inherit the paradoxical behavior of the liar sentence, an infinite sequence of sentences can be constructed that inherit the distinctive behavior of the G{\"o}del sentence. This phenomenon---the transfer of the properties of self-referential sentences of formal mathematics to their ``unwindings'' into infinite sequences of sentences---suggests a number of interesting logical questions. The purpose of this paper is to give a precise statement of a conjecture from Cie{\'{s}}li{\'{n}}ski and Urbaniak (2012) regarding the unwinding of the Rosser sentence, and to demonstrate that this precise statement is false. We begin with some preliminary motivation, introduce the conjecture against the background of some related results, and finally, in the last section, move on to the proof, which adapts a method used by Solovay and Guaspari.",issn="1573-0433",doi="10.1007/s10992-013-9291-5",url="http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10992-013-9291-5"

%%abstract = "Thomas Bradwardine makes much of the fact that his solution to the insolubles is in accordance with Aristotle's diagnosis of the fallacy in the Liar paradox as that of <I>secundum quid et simpliciter</I>. Paul Spade, however, claims that this invocation of Aristotle by Bradwardine is purely "honorary" in order to confer specious respectability on his analysis and give it a spurious weight of authority. Our answer to Spade follows Bradwardine's response to the problem of revenge: any proposition saying of itself that it is false says more than does Bradwardine's proposition saying of it that it is false, and so follows from that other proposition only in respect of part of what it says, and not <I>simpliciter</I>.",

title="Dangerous Reference Graphs and Semantic Paradoxes",
journal="Journal of Philosophical Logic",
year="2013",
volume="42",
number="5",
pages="727-765",
abstract="The semantic paradoxes are often associated with self-reference or referential circularity. Yablo (Analysis 53(4):251--252, 1993), however, has shown that there are infinitary versions of the paradoxes that do not involve this form of circularity. It remains an open question what relations of reference between collections of sentences afford the structure necessary for paradoxicality. In this essay, we lay the groundwork for a general investigation into the nature of reference structures that support the semantic paradoxes and the semantic hypodoxes. We develop a functionally complete infinitary propositional language endowed with a denotation assignment and extract the reference structural information in terms of graph-theoretic properties. We introduce the new concepts of dangerous and precarious reference graphs, which allows us to rigorously define the task: classify the dangerous and precarious directed graphs purely in terms of their graph-theoretic properties. Ungroundedness will be shown to fully characterize the precarious reference graphs and fully characterize the dangerous finite graphs. We prove that an undirected graph has a dangerous orientation if and only if it contains a cycle, providing some support for the traditional idea that cyclic structure is required for paradoxicality. This leaves the task of classifying danger for infinite acyclic reference graphs. We provide some compactness results, which give further necessary conditions on danger in infinite graphs, which in conjunction with a notion of self-containment allows us to prove that dangerous acyclic graphs must have infinitely many vertices with infinite out-degree. But a full characterization of danger remains an open question. In the appendices we relate our results to the results given in Cook (J Symb Log 69(3):767--774, 2004) and Yablo (2006) with respect to more restricted sentences systems, which we call                                                                           {\$}{\backslash}mathcal{\{}F{\}}{\$}                -systems.",

Evidence is presented that all one-dimensional cellular automata fall into four distinct universality classes. Characterizations of the structures generated in these classes are discussed. Three classes exhibit behaviour analogous to limit points, limit cycles and chaotic attractors. The fourth class is probably capable of universal computation, so that properties of its infinite time behaviour are undecidable."
