The principle that every model of the strengthened set theory is embedded in a larger one then be comes, "there are unboundedly many hyperinaccessible cardinals," and so modal structuralism provides a kind of argument for the existence of hyperinaccessibles. Hellman has worked out analogous arguments for strong Mahlo cardinals, hyper-Mahlo cardinals, and so forth, though not
for weakly compact cardinals [HeI89, pp. 83-91].
