Propositional quantifier

Using FOL means treating "not" and "necessarily" differently

<br>

$\forall x (Fx) \rightarrow \Box Fx, \forall x (Fx) \rightarrow Nc$ trivializes the quantifier 

<br>

$N[Fi]$

$[Fi]$: proposition or sentence?

if sentence: a sentence is not what we believe

if proposition: 

$\forall p \exists q (q=\Box p)$

$\forall x \exists y (y=[Nx])$;

$\forall p \exists q (q=\lnot p)$

$\forall x \exists y (y=[\lnot x])$, ill-founded

$\forall x \exists y (y=[\sim x])$

and is it the case that $[\sim x]=[\lnot Tx]$, we don't know

<br>

To formalize "Everything K believes is true", propositional quantifiers does not need the truth predicate

Jupiter could not be a planet

$\{\lozenge \lnot j, \lnot \lozenge j\}$
