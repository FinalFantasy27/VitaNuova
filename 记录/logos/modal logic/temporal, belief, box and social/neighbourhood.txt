tautology=valid in canonical model = valid
consistency lemma. The set of formulas satisfied by any state in any model is maximal consistent.
Truth lemma. [\phi]^C={w|\phi\in w}, w a maximal consistent set
Lindenbaum lemma. If w is a consistent then there is a maximal consistent v cotains w

box model M=<S,O,V> where OX \subseteq S for each X \subseteq S

box: axioms and rules. |-\phi if \phi a tautology, mp, substitution, if |-\phi<->\psi then \Box \phi<->\Box \psi
exercise: prove replacement of logical equivalents. if |-phi<->\psi, then |-\theta[\phi]<->\theta[\psi]

canonical box model. C=<S_C,O_C,V_C> is defined by S_C the set of all maximal box consistent sets of formulas, V_C(p)={w|p \in w}, O_C X={v|for every \phi, \Box\phi \in v if X={w|\phi\in w}}

neighbourhodd model M=<S,N,V> where, for each state s, Ns is a set of subsets of S, called the neighbourhoods of s 
M,s|=\Box\phi iff [\phi]^M\in Ns

if you have a box mode, you can define a neighbourhood mdoel like this Ns={X|s\in OX}, and likewise, for a neighbourhood model define a box model OX={s| X\in Ns}
so we can view the canonical box model C as neighbourhood model <S_C,N_C,V_C> with N_C s={[\phi]^C|\Box\phi\in s}

A neighbourhood model is normal if 1. it contains top: S\in Ns, 2. is closure under intersection: if P\subseteq Ns then \cap P\in Ns, 3. upward closed. if X \in Ns and X\subseteq Y then Y\in Ns
principles for normal models. 1. if |=\phi then |=\Box\phi, 2. |=(\Box p \land \Box q)->\Box(p \land q), 3. |=\phi->\psi then \Box\phi->\Box\psi, 4. |=\Box(p->q)->(\Box p -> \Box q)
C contains top iff 1., closed under intersection implies 2. (2. implies that C is closed under finite intersections), upward closed iff 3.

normal modal logic. tautology, mp, substitution, necessitation, |-\Box(p->q)->(\Box p -> \Box q)
canonical completeness, Kripke model. given a neighbourhood model M=<S,N,V>, define relation R on S by Rst iff t\in\cap Ns, i.e. t is in every neighbourhood of s
M is normal iff Ns={X\subseteq S| t\in X for all t such that Rst}, normal models can be represented as <S, R, V>
