information cells for a: [s]_a={t|s~_a t}
single agent LK models: M_{sa}=<[s]_a,<=_a,V_s> with V_s(p)=V(p) intersects with [s]_a
every subset of [s]_a has a <=_a maximal state, i.e. if x \subseteq [s]_a then there is t \in X such that u<=_a for every u \in x.
to get the maximal states property in infinite models we need to add another frame condition: there are no infinite sequences of increasingly plausible states: s_0<_a s_1<...

axioms for multi-LK: L_a and K_a are normal, L_a has S5 axioms, K_a has S4 axioms, |-L_a p->K_a p,|-(L_a(p \lor K_aq)\land L_a(q\lor K_a p))->(L_a p \lor L_a q)

defining belief: s|= B_a(\phi : \psi) iff t|=\psi for every t such that t|=\phi and t>=_a u for every u~_a s such that u|=\phi
s|=\overset{\dot}B_a \phi iff t|= \phi for some t~_a s and u|=\phi for every u~_a s for which there is a v<=_a u with v|=\phi 
|-B_a(p:q)<->(M_a p->M_a(p\land K_a(p->q)))
|-\overset{\dot}B_a<->(M_a p \land L_a(p\rightarrow K_a p))
