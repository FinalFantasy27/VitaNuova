Danny came to lunch very excited one day, brandishing a piece of paper, saying “I’ve just proved that God is not omniscient!” On the paper he had written

This proposition is not known to be true by anyone.

If it is false, then obviously it is not known to be true by anyone, so what it says is the case, so it is not false. Fine, it is not false — therefore it is true. Being true, what it says is the case, so it is not known to be true by anyone. Here is a true proposition that is not known even by God! Corollary: God is not omniscient!

On one of the first days Fitch mentioned quietly that he was sure he would go to heaven. After all, he said, he had done something for God: he had proved his existence.

It seemed that each year he would end his seminar by proving God’s existence. On that first occasion, though, he confessed that he was still not satisfied with his proof, because by his reasoning, God turned out to be a relation. But before I left Yale, and I asked him about it, he was satisfied: in his improved proof, God turned out to be a proposition. Not just any proposition, but the one true proposition that implies all true propositions — which, he said, was surely so special that it deserved to be worshipped.
