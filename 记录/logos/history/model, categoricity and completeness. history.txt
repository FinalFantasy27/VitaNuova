More precisely Awodey and Reck point out that in the 2nd edition of Fraenkel's book (1923) he had distinguished between categoricity and deductive completeness.

Corcoran [Corcoran 1980] points out that Veblen in 1904 distinguishes deductive and semantic completeness but confuses semantic completeness and categoricity. Corcoran relates the generally unsettled nature of these notions in the first decades of the twentieth century and raises a number of precise historical questions.
