Godel once told that he realized undefinability of truth firstly, then the incompleteness.
The stuff is Wang, H. (1981). Some Facts About Kurt Gödel. The Journal of Symbolic Logic, 46(3), 653–659. https://doi.org/10.2307/2273764. A self-description of Godel also appears in Hao Wang's A Logical Journey from Goedel to Philosophy, cha.2.5.


"Less than a week after the meeting, Zermelo wrote Godel to announce
that he had found a gap i n Godel's proof. He questioned whether Godel's
example of an undecidable proposition was actually a statement
within Godel's system and endeavored to show that i t was not by asserting that the same method would yield "a contradiction analogous to
Russell's antinomy" if Godel's formal provability predicate Bew were replaced by the corresponding truth predicate." (Collected Works, V, p.419)
