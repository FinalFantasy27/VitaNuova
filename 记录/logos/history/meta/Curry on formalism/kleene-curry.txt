his use of the prefix "epi-" instead of "meta-" is a result of the fact that Kleene, in a review of one of his papers from the early 1940s, objected to his use of the prefix "meta". (Kleene's objection was that the use of the prefix implied that the underlying formalism was based on the assumption that the formal objects were assumed to be strings of symbols, whereas in Curry's conception of a
formal system, they can be the elements of any inductively generated set. This objection may have been valid in the early 1940s, but by the late 1950s and early 1960s, most logicians were using the prefix "meta-" in a sense so close to Curry's use of "epi-" that Curry would probably have done better to stick with "meta-" and introduce a remark or a footnote at an appropriate place explaining that his use of the prefix might differ from that of some others.)
