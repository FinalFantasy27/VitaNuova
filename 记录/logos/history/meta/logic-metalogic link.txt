I call this the logic-metalogic link. There are two facets to the logic-metalogic link. First, when a logic is entangled with a substantive issue, the same position on that issue should be taken at the meta- level as at the object level; and second, if an expression has a clear meaning in natural language, then the corresponding concept can equally well be deployed in a formal language.

Second-order Logic and the Power Set

For first order logic it can be proved that “M |=_s  ϕ” is an absolute property of M, s and ϕ relative to ZFC. But Second-order is not. semantics of first order logic is absolute relative to ZFC. This gives some assurance that we need not continue asking, what the metatheory is.
