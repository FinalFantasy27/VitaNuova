The choice of primitive notions for a topic is by no means unique.Forexample, formulated in a vocabulary with only a binary function symbol,the theory of groups needs ∀∃-axioms (page 106) and groups are not closedunder subalgebra.Adding a constant for the identity, and a unary func-tion for inverse, turns groups into a universally (∀: only universal quan-tif i ers) axiomatized class that is closed under substructure.Alternatively,groups can be formulated with one ternary relation as the only symbol inthe vocabulary.The three resulting theories are pairwise bi-interpretable. baldwin36
