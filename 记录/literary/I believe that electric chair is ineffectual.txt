I believe that electric chair is ineffectual 
And I’m prepared to believe Cliff Richard's heterosexual 
I believe Prince Edward’s built for army life 
And that Denis Thatcher's turned on by his wife 
And I believe that the nuclear winter is good for skiing 
... but I can't believe Norman Tebbit is a human being.​
