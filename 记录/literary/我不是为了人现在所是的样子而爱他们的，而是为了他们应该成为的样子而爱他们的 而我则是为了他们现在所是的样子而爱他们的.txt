雨果说：“我并不是因为人类现在的所是，而是为了他们应该成为的那种样子才爱他们的”（五幕三场）

贺德雷说：“而我却是因为人类现在的所是而爱他们的”

萨特《脏手》

萨特转述加缪说照他的看法似乎应该相反，加缪“”认为雨果是因为人类的现状而爱他们的，因为他不愿意欺骗他们，而在加缪看来，贺德雷则相反是个教条主义的共产党员，他把人类看作是他们应该成为的那个样子，并且他还以某种理想的名义来欺骗他们。然而这与我（萨特）想说的恰恰相反。”（萨特著作目录及提要，米歇尔•贡塔 等编，238，收录于萨特，词语，潘培庆 译，185-348）



HUGO [with difficulty]: You can't make a revolution with flowers. If there's no other way—
HCEDERER: Then?
HUGO. Why then, so much the worse!
HCEDERER: There you are! You can see for yourself! You don't love men, Hugo. You love
only principles.
HUGO: Men? Why should I love them? Do they love me?
HCEDERER Then why did you come to us? If you don't love men, you can't fight for them.
HUGO: I joined the party because its cause is just, and I shall leave it when that cause ceases to
be just. As for men, it's not what they are that interests me, but what they can be-come.
HCEDERER: And I, I love them for what they are. With all their filth and all their vices. I love
their voices and their warm grasping hands, and their skin, the nudest skin of all, and their
uneasy glances, and the desperate struggle each has to pursue against anguish and against death.
For me, one man more or less in the world is something that counts. It's something precious.
You, I know you now, you are a de-stroyer. You detest men because you detest yourself. Your
purity resembles death. The revolution you dream of is not ours. You don't want to change the
world, you want to blow it up.
