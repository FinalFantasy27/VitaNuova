Four Quartets : Burnt Norton

"Although logos is common to all, most people live
as if they had a wisdom of their own."
"The way upward and the way downward are the same."

I

Time present and time past
Are both perhaps present in time future,
And time future contained in time past.
If all time is eternally present
All time is unredeemable.
What might have been is an abstraction
Remaining a perpetual possibility
Only in a world of speculation.
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.
Footfalls echo in the memory
Down the passage which we did not take
Towards the door we never opened
Into the rose-garden. My words echo
Thus, in your mind.
　　　　　　　　　　But to what purpose
Disturbing the dust on a bowl of rose-leaves
I do not know.
　　　　　　　　Other echoes
Inhabit the garden. Shall we follow?
Quick, said the bird, find them, find them,
Round the corner. Through the first gate,
Into our first world, shall we follow
The deception of the thrush? Into our first world.
There they were, dignified, invisible,
Moving without pressure, over the dead leaves,
In the autumn heat, through the vibrant air,
And the bird called, in response to
The unheard music hidden in the shrubbery,
And the unseen eyebeam crossed, for the roses
Had the look of flowers that are looked at.
There they were as our guests, accepted and accepting.
So we moved, and they, in a formal pattern,
Along the empty alley, into the box circle,
To look down into the drained pool.
Dry the pool, dry concrete, brown edged,
And the pool was filled with water out of sunlight,
And the lotos rose, quietly, quietly,
The surface glittered out of heart of light,
And they were behind us, reflected in the pool.
Then a cloud passed, and the pool was empty.
Go, said the bird, for the leaves were full of children,
Hidden excitedly, containing laughter.
Go, go, go, said the bird: human kind
Cannot bear very much reality.
Time past and time future
What might have been and what has been
Point to one end, which is always present.


II

Garlic and sapphire in the mud
Clot the bedded axle-tree.
The trilling wire in the blood
Sings below inveterate scars
Appeasing long-forgotten wars.
The dance along the artery
The circulation of the lymph
Are figured in the drift of stars
Ascend to summer in the tree
We move above the moving tree
In light upon the figured leaf
And hear upon the sodden floor
Below, the boarhound and the boar
Pursue their pattern as before
But reconciled among the stars.

At the still point of the turning world. Neither flesh nor fleshless;
Neither from nor towards; at the still point, there the dance is,
Bur neither arrest not movement. And do not call it fixity,
Where past and future are gathered. Neither movement from nor towards,
Neither ascent nor decline. Except for the point, the still point,
There would be no dance, and there is only the dance.
I can only say, there we have been: but I cannot say where.
And I cannot say, how long, for that is to place it in time.
The inner freedom from the practical desire,
The release from action and suffering, release from the inner
And the outer compulsion, yet surrounded
By a grace of sense, a white light still and moving,
Erhebung without motion, concentration
Without elimination, both a new world
And the old made explicit, understood

In the completion of its partial ecstasy,
The resolution of its partial horror.
Yet the enchainment of past and future
Woven into the weakness of the changing body,
Protects mankind from heaven and damnation
Which flesh cannot endure.
　　　　Time past and time future
Allow but a little consciousness.
To be conscious is not to be in time
Bur only in time can the moment in the rose-garden,
The moment in the arbour where the rain beat,
The moment in the draughty church at smokefall
Be remembered; involved with past and future.
Only through time time is conquered.

III

Here is a place of disaffection
Time before and time after
In a dim light: neither daylight
Investing form with a lucid stillness
Turning shadow into transient beauty
With slow rotation suggesting permanence
Nor darkness to purify the soul
Emptying the sensual with deprivation
Cleansing affection from the temporal.
Neither plenitude nor vacancy. Only a flicker
Over the strained time-ridden faces
Distracted from distraction by distraction
Filled with fancies and empty of meaning
Tumid apathy with no concentration
Men and bits of paper, whirled by the cold wind
That blows before and after time,
Time before and time after.
Eructation of unhealthy souls
Into the faded air, the torpid
Driven on the wind that sweeps the gloomy hills of London,
Hampstead and Clerkenwell, Campden and Putney,
Highgate, Primrose and Ludgate. Mot here
Not here the darkness, in this twittering world.

Descend lower, descend only
Into the world of perpetual solitude,
World not world, but that which is not world,
Internal darkness, deprivation
And destitution of all property,
Desiccation of the world of sense,
Evacuation of the world of fancy,
Inoperancy of the world of spirit;

This is the one way, and the other
Is the same, not in movement
But abstention from movement; while the world moves
In appetency, on its metalled ways
Of time past and time future.

IV

Time and the bell have buried the day,
The black cloud carries the sun away.
Will the sunflower turn to us, will the clematis
Stray down, bend to us; tendril and spray
Clutch and cling?
Chill
Fingers of yew be curled
Down on us? After the kingfisher's wing
Has answered light to light, and is silent, the light is still
At the still point of the turning world.

V

Words move, music moves
Only in time; but that which is only living
Can only die. Words, after speech, reach
Into the silence. Only by the form, the pattern,
Can words or music reach
The stillness, as a Chinese jar still
Moves perpetually in its stillness.
Not the stillness of the violin, while the note lasts,
Not that only, but the co-existence,
Or say that the end precedes the beginning,
And the end and the beginning were always there
Before the beginning and after the end.
And all is always now. Words strain,
Crack and sometimes break, under the burden,
Under the tension, slip, slide, perish,
Decay with imprecision, will not stay in place,
Will not stay still. Shrieking voices
Scolding, mocking, or merely chattering,
Always assail them. The Word in the desert
Is most attacked by voices of temptation,
The crying shadow in the funeral dance,
The loud lament of the disconsolate chimera.

The detail of the pattern is movement,
As in the figure of the ten stairs.
Desire itself is movement
Not in itself desirable;
　　Love is itself unmoving,
　　Only the cause and end of movement,
　　Timeless, and undesiring
　　Except in the aspect of time
　　Caught in the form of limitation
　　Between un-being and being.
　　Sudden in a shaft of sunlight
　　Even while the dust moves
　　There rises the hidden laughter
　　Of children in the foliage
　　Quick now, here, now, always -
　　Ridiculous the waste sad time
　　Stretching before and after.

艾略特:《四个四重奏》
汤永宽 译

一、焚毁的诺顿

纵然语言为人所共有，但多数人立身处世仿佛各有其到。
向上的路和向下的路是完全一样的。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
一
现在的时间和过去的时间
也许都存在于未来的时间，
而未来的时间又包容于过去的时间。
假若全部时间永远存在
全部时间就再也都无法挽回。
过去可能存在的是一种抽象
只是在一个猜测的世界中，
保持着一种恒久的可能性。
过去可能存在和已经存在的
都指向一个始终存在的终点。
足音在记忆中回响
沿着那条我们从未走过的甬道
飘向那重我们从未打开的门
进入玫瑰园。我的话就和这样
在你的心中回响。
　　　　　　　但是为了什么
更在一缸玫瑰花瓣上搅起尘埃
我却不知道。
　　 　　还有一些回声
栖身在花园里。我们要不要去追蹑？
快，鸟儿说，快去寻找它们，去寻找它们
在花园角落里。穿过第一道门，
走进我们的第一个世界，我们要不要听从
画眉的欺骗？进入我们的第一个世界。
它们就在那儿，神态庄严而不可窥见，
在秋天的燠热里，穿过颤动的空气，
从容不迫地越过满地枯叶，
鸟儿在呼唤，于那隐藏在灌木丛中
不可闻见的音乐相应和，
那没有被人看见的眼光转过去了，因为玫瑰
露出了花容美姿已被人窥见的神色。
它们在那儿仿佛是我们的客人
受到我们的接待也在接待我们。
它们彬彬有礼地伫立在空寂的小径旁。
于是我们继续前行，走进黄杨木的圆形树丛，
俯身观看那干涸的水池。
干涸的水池、干涸的混凝土、围着褐色的边，
水池里注满了阳光变幻的水，
荷花升起了，悄悄地，悄悄地，
池面从光芒的中心闪现，
而它们在我们身后，映照在池中。
接着云朵飘过，水池又变为空虚。
去吧，鸟儿说，因为树叶丛中躲满了孩子
他们兴冲冲地藏在那儿，忍住了笑声。
去吧，去吧，去吧，鸟儿说：人类
忍受不了太多的现实。
过去的时间和未来的时间
过去可能存在的和已经存在的
都指向一个始终存在在终点。

二

大蒜和蓝宝石陷在泥里
阻塞了装嵌的轮轴。
血液中发着颤音的弦
在永不消失的伤疤下歌唱
安抚那早已忘却的战争。
动脉里的舞蹈
淋巴液的环流
都表现为星辰的流驶
在树梢中升向夏天
我们在摇动的树枝上空
在那斑驳的树叶上闪耀的光华中
移步前行，耳听得下面湿润的土地上
捕捉野猪的猎犬和野猪一如既往
在继续他们追逐的模式
但在群星中又归于和解。
在转动不息的世界的静止点上，既无生灵也无精魂；
但是不止也无动。在这静止点上，只有舞蹈，
不停止也不移动。可别把它叫做固定不移。
过去和未来就在这里回合。无去无从，
无升无降。只有这个点，这个静止点，
这里原不会有舞蹈，但这里有的只是舞蹈。
我只能说，我们曾在那儿呆过，但我说不出是哪儿。
我也说不出呆了多久，因为这样就把它纳入时间。
内心超脱了显示的欲求，
解脱了行动和苦痛，也解脱了内心
和身外的逼迫，而被围拥在
一种恩宠之感，一道静静的白光之中，
徐徐上升而有凝然不动，集中
在它部分的狂喜
达到圆满的过程中，才领悟到
它那部分的恐惧已经消失。
但是过去和未来的羁绊
交织在变化着的软弱的躯体中，
卫护着人类既不飞升天国也不堕入地狱
这两者都非血肉之躯所能忍受。
　　　　　　　　　　过去的时间和未来的时间
只容许有少许的意识。
能意识到就不在时间之内
但是只有在时间之内，那在玫瑰园中的瞬间，
那雨声沥沥的凉亭里的瞬间，
当烟雾降落在通风的教堂里的瞬间，
才能忆起；才能与过去和未来相及。
只有通过时间才被征服时间。

三

这是愤怼不满的地方
以前的时间和以后的时间
都沉浸于一片朦胧的光影里：既没有日光
赋予形体以明澈和静穆
把暗淡的阴影化为疏忽易逝的美
以暖地旋转暗示人生悠悠，
也没有黑暗使灵魂净化
剥夺一切去消感官的享乐
洗涤情感以摈绝尘世短暂的情爱。
既非充实也非空虚。只有一抹微光
闪摇在一张张紧张的饱经忧患的脸上
都因为心烦意乱而毫无意义
神情无所专注而极度冷漠
冷风劲吹在时间之前和时间之后
人和纸片都在风中回旋，
孱弱的肺叶呼吸出入
不健康的灵魂把嗳出的麻木
吐入枯萎的空气，被风卷带着掠过
伦敦的阴沉的山岗，掠过汉姆斯蒂德
和克拉肯韦尔、坎普顿和普特尼，
海盖特、普林姆罗斯和拉德格特。
不是这里，不是这里的黑暗一片
不在这颤抖的世界里。
再往下去，只是往下进入
永远与外世隔绝的世界，
是世界又非世界，非世界的世界，
内部黑暗，剥夺了一切
赤贫如洗，一无所有，
感觉已枯竭的世界，
幻想已远走高飞的世界，
精神已失去作用的世界；
这是一条路，另外一条路
也是一样，不在运动之中
而是避开运动；但是世界却怀着渴望
在过去的时间和未来的时间的
碎石路上前进。

四

时间和晚钟埋葬了白天，
乌云卷走了太阳。
向日葵会转向我们吗，铁线莲？
会纷披下来俯向我们吗；卷须的小花枝头
会抓住我们，缠住我们吗？
冷冽的
紫杉的手指会弯到
我们身上吗？当翠鸟的翅膀
以光明回答光明以后
现在已悄然无声，光明凝然不动
在这转动不息的世界的静止点上。

五

语言，音乐，都只能
在时间中行进；但是唯有生者
才能死灭。语言，一旦说过，就归于
静寂。只有通过形式，模式，
语言或音乐才能达到
静止，正如一只中国的瓷瓶
静止不动而仍然在时间中不断前进。
当乐曲余音袅袅，那不是提琴的静止，
不只如此，而是两者共存，
或者说结束于开始，
结束和开始永远在那儿
在开始之前和结束之后。
万物永远存在于现在。语言
在重负之下，损伤，迸裂，有时甚至破碎，
而在压力之下，要跌落，溜走，消失，
或者因为措辞不当而腐朽，不会在原处停留，
不会停留不动。尖厉刺耳的声音
叱责、嘲笑或者只是絮叨
受到的攻击总是试探的声音，
是葬仪舞蹈中哀声哭喊的影子，
是郁郁不乐的凯米艾拉的高声悲号。
模式的细节是运动，
正如以十级阶梯的形状表现的那样。
欲望本身就是运动
而不在与它值得想望的本身，
爱本身是静止不动的，
只是运动的原因和目的，
无始无终，也无所企求
除非在时间方面
被纳入了限制的形式
介于存在和不存在之间。
猛然间，在一道阳光中
即使此时有尘灰飞扬
在绿叶丛中扬起了
孩子们吃吃的笑声
迅疾的现在，这里，现在，永远——
荒唐可笑的是那虚度的悲苦的时间
伸展在这之前和之后。

Four Quartets : Little Gidding

I

Midwinter spring is its own season
Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown,
Suspended in time, between pole and tropic.
When the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,
The brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,
In windless cold that is the heart's heat,
Reflecting in a watery mirror
A glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.
And glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,
Stirs the dumb spirit: no wind, but pentecostal fire
In the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing
The soul's sap quivers. There is no earth smell
Or smell of living thing. This is the spring time
But not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow
Is blanched for an hour with transitory blossom
Of snow, a bloom more sudden
Than that of summer, neither budding nor fading,
Not in the scheme of generation.
Where is the summer, the unimaginable
Zero summer?
If you came this way,
Taking the route you would be likely to take
From the place you would be likely to come from,
If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges
White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.
It would be the same at the end of the journey,
If you came at night like a broken king,
If you came by day not knowing what you came for,
It would be the same, when you leave the rough road
And turn behind the pig- sty to the dull fa?ade
And the tombstone. And what you thought you came for
Is only a shell, a husk of meaning
From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled
If at all. Either you had no purpose
Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured
And is altered in fulfilment. There are other places
Which also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,
Or over a dark lake, in a desert or a city -
But this is the nearest, in place and time,
Now and in England.

If you came this way,
Taking any route, starting from anywhere,
At any time or at any season,
It would always be the same: you would have to put off
Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity
Or carry report. You are here to kneel
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more
Than an order of words, the conscious occupation
Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.
And what the dead had no speech for, when living,
They can tell you, being dead: the communication
Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.
Here, the intersection of the timeless moment
Is England and nowhere. Never and always.

II

Ash on an old man's sleeve
Is all the ash the burnt roses leave.
Dust in the air suspended
Marks the place where a story ended.
Dust inbreathed was a house -
The wall, the wainscot and the mouse.
The death of hope and despair,
This is the death of air.

There are flood and drouth
Over the eyes and in the mouth,
Dead water and dead sand
Contending for the upper hand.
The parched eviscerate soil
Gapes at the vanity of toil,
Laughs without mirth.
This is the death of earth.

Water and fire succeed
The town, the pasture and the weed.
Water and fire deride
The sacrifice that we denied.
Water and fire shall rot
The marred foundations we forgot,
Of sanctuary and choir.
This is the death of water and fire.

In the uncertain hour before the morning
Near the ending of interminable night
At the recurrent end of the unending
After the dark dove with the flickering tongue
Had passed below the horizon of his homing
While the dead leaves still rattled on like tin
Over the asphalt where no other sound was
Between three districts whence the smoke arose
I met one walking, loitering and hurried
As if blown towards me like the metal leaves
Before the urban dawn wind unresisting.
And as I fixed upon the down-turned face
That pointed scrutiny with which we challenge
The first-met stranger in the waning dusk
I caught the sudden look of some dead master
Whom I had known, forgotten, half recalled
Both one and many; in the brown baked features
The eyes of a familiar compound ghost
Both intimate and unidentifiable.
So I assumed a double part, and cried
And heard another's voice cry : 'What! are you here?'
Although we were not. I was still the same,
Knowing myself yet being someone other -
And he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed
To compel the recognition they preceded.
And so, compliant to the common wind,
Too strange to each other for misunderstanding,
In concord at this intersection time
Of meeting nowhere, no before or after,
We trod the pavement in a dead patrol.
I said: 'The wonder that I feel is easy,
Yet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak:
I may not comprehend, may not remember.'
And he: 'I am not eager to rehearse
My thought and theory which you have forgotten.
These things have served their purpose: let them be.
So with your own, and pray they be forgiven
By others, as I pray you to forgive
Both bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten
And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.
For last year's words belong to last year's language
And next year's words await another voice.
Bur, as the passage now presents no hindrance
To the spirit unappeased and peregrine
Between two worlds become much like each other,
So I find words I never thought to speak
In streets I never thought I should revisit
When I left my body on a distant shore.
Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us
To purify the dialect of the tribe
And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight,
Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age
To set a crown upon your lifetime's effort.
First, the cold friction of expiring sense
Without enchantment, offering no promise
But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit
As body and soul begin to fall asunder.
Second, the conscious impotence of rage
At human folly, and the laceration
Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.
And last, the rending pain of re-enactment
Of all that you have done, and been; the shame
Of motives late revealed, and the awareness
Of things ill done and done to others' harm
Which once you took for exercise of virtue.
Then fools' approval stings, and honour stains.
From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit
Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fire
Where you must move in measure, like a dancer.'
The day was breaking. In the disfigured street
He left me, with a kind of valediction,
And faded on the blowing of the horn.

III

There are three conditions which often look alike
Yet differ completely, flourish in the same hedgerow:
Attachment of self and to things and to persons, detachment
From self and from things and from persons; and, growing
between them, indifference
Which resembles the others as death resembles life,
Being between two lives - unflowering, between
The live and the dead nettle. This is the use of memory:
For liberation - not less of love but expanding

Of love beyond desire, and so liberation
From the future as well as the past. Thus, love of a country
Begins as attachment to our own field of action
And comes to find that action of little importance
Though never indifferent. History may be servitude,
History may be freedom. See, now they vanish,
The faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved
Them,
To become renewed, transfigured, in another pattern.
Sin is Behovely, but
All shall be well, and
All manner of thing shall be well.
If I think, again, of this place,
And of people, not wholly commendable,
Of no immediate kin or kindness,
But some of peculiar genius,
All touched by a common genius,
United in the strife which divided them;
If I think of a king at nightfall,
Of three men, and more, on the scaffold
And a few who died forgotten
In other places, here and abroad,
And of one who died blind and quiet
Why should we celebrate
These dead men more than the dying?
It is not to ring the bell backward
Nor is it an incantation
To summon the spectre of a Rose.
We cannot revive old factions
We cannot restore old policies
Or follow an antique drum.
These men, and those who opposed them
And those whom they opposed
Accept the constitution of silence
And are folded in a single party.
Whatever we inherit from the fortunate
We have taken from the defeated
What they had to leave us - a symbol:
A symbol perfected in death.
And all shall be well and
All manner of thing shall be well
By the purification of the motive
In the ground of our beseeching.

IV

The dove descending breaks the air
With flame of incandescent terror

Of which the tongues declare
The one discharge from sin and error.
The only hope, or else despair
Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre -
To be redeemed from fire by fire.

Who then devised the torment? Love.
Love is the unfamiliar Name
Behind the hands that wove
The intolerable shirt of flame
Which human power cannot remove.
We only live, only suspire
Consumed by either fire or fire.

V

What we call the beginning is often the end
And to make an end is to make a beginning.
The end is where we start from. And every phrase
And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,
Taking its place to support the others,
The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,
An easy commerce of the old and the new,
The common word exact without vulgarity,
The formal word precise but not pedantic,
The complete consort dancing together)
Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,
Every poem an epitaph. And any action
Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat
Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.
We die with the dying:
See, they depart, and we go with them.
We are born with the dead:
See, they return, and bring us with them.
The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
Are of equal duration. A people without history
Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern
Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails
On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel
History is now and England.

四、小吉丁

一

仲东的春天是它自己的季节
漫漫永昼而到日落却一片湿润，
悬在时间中，在极圈和回归线之间。
当短暂的白昼因为寒霜和火成为最明亮的时刻，
匆促的太阳点燃了地上和沟里的冰，
在无风的冷冽中那是心的热，
在一面似水的镜子里
映照出一道刺目的强光，
在就是晌午时分之所以令人眩目而一无所见。
灼热的光比柴枝的火更烈比火盆更旺，
激起麻木的精神：没有风，只有圣灵降临节的火
在这一年的黑暗时节。在融化和结冰之间
灵魂的活力在颤抖。没有大地的气息
或者有生命之物的气息。这是春天季节
但不是在约定的时间之内。现在树篱
因为雪花短暂开放而一时满身素白，
一次比夏花绽放更突然的花开，
既未含葩待放也不会凋零谢落，
不在世代蕃衍的计划之内。
夏天在哪里？那不可想象的
零度的夏天？

如果你到这里来，
选择你可能选择的路线
从你可能出那里来的地方来，
如果你在山楂花开的时候到这里来，
你会发现五月里，树篱又变白了，
飘散这迷人的甜香。
到旅程的终点都一样，
如果你像一位困顿的国王夤夜而来，
如果你白天来又不知道你为何而来，
那都一样，当你离开崎岖的小径
在猪栏后面拐向那阴暗的前庭和墓碑的时候。
你原先以为是你此行的目的
现在不过是意义的一层贝壳，一层荚
只要有什么目的能实现的话，目的才破壳而出。
或者是你原先根本没有目的
或者是目的在于你是想象的终点之外
而在实现的过程中已经改变。另有一些地方
也是世界的终点，有的在海的入口
或者在一片黑暗的湖上，在沙漠中
或者在一座城市里——
但是在地点和时间上，这里是最近的地方，
现在和在英格兰。

如果你到这里来，
不论走哪条路，从哪里出发，
在哪个地方或哪个季节，
那都是一样：你必须抛开
感觉和思想。你到这里来不是为了证明什么，
教诲自己，或者告诉什么新奇的事物
或者传送报告。你到这里来
是到祈祷一向是正当的地方来
俯首下跪。祈祷不只是
一种话语，祈祷者头脑的
清醒的活动，或者是祈求呼告的声音。
死者活着的时候，无法以言词表达的，
他们作为死者能告诉你：死者的交流思想
超乎生者的语言之外是用火表达的。
这里，无始无终的瞬间的交叉点是英格兰，
而不是任何其他地方。决不而且永远。

二

一个老人衣袖上的灰
是焚烧的玫瑰留下的全部尘灰。
尘灰悬在空中
标志着一个故事在这里告终。
你吸入的尘灰曾经是一座宅邸——
墙、护壁板和耗子。
希望和希望的死亡，
这是空气的死亡。

在眼睛之上，在嘴巴里
有洪水和干旱，
止水和死沙
在争斗着谁占上风。
坼裂的失去元气的泥土
张目结舌地望着徒然无益的劳动，
放声大笑而没有欢乐。
这是土的死亡。

水和火取代
城镇、牧场和野草。
水和火嘲弄
我们拒绝奉献的牺牲。
水和火也必将腐蚀
我们遗忘的圣殿和唱诗席的
已经毁坏的基础。
这是水和火的死亡。

在黎明来临前无法确知的时刻
漫漫长夜行将结束
永无终止又到了终点
当黑黝黝的鸽子喷吐着忽隐忽现的火舌
在地平线下掠飞归去以后
在硝烟升腾的三个地区之间
再没有别的声息只有枯叶像白铁皮一般
嘎嘎作响地扫过沥青路面
这时我遇见一个在街上闲荡的行人
像被不可阻挡的城市晨风吹卷的
金属薄片急匆匆地向我走来。
当我用锐利而审视的目光
打量他那张低垂的脸庞
就像我们盘问初次遇见的陌生人那样
在即将消逝的暮色中
我瞧见一位曾经相识、但已淡忘的已故的大师
突然显现的面容，我恍惚记得
他既是一个又是许多个；晒黒的脸上
一个熟识的复合的灵魂的眼睛
既亲密又不可辨认。
因此我反复了一个双重角色，一面喊叫
一面又听另一个人喊叫：“啊！你在这里？”
尽管我们都不是。我还是我，
但我知道我自己已经成了另一个人——
而他只是一张还在形成的脸；但语言已足够
强迫他们承认曾经相识。
因此，按照一般的风尚，
双方既然素昧平生也就不可能产生误会，
我们在这千载难逢，没有以前也没有以后的
交叉时刻和谐地漫步在行人道上作一次死亡的巡逻。
我说：“我感到惊异是那么轻松安适，
然而轻松正是惊异的原因。所以说，
我也许并不理解，也许不复记忆。”
他却说：“我的思想和原则已被你遗忘，
我不想再一次详细申诉。
这些东西已经满足了它们的需要：由它们去吧。
你自己的也是这样，祈求别人宽恕它们吧，
就像我祈求你宽恕善与恶一样。上季的果子
已经吃过，喂饱了的野兽也一定会把空桶踢开。
因为去年的话属于去年的语言
而来年的话还在等待另一种语调。
但是，对于来自异域没有得到抚慰的灵魂，
在两个已变得非常相像的世界之间
现在道路已畅通无阻，
所以当我把我的躯体
委弃在遥远的岸边以后
我在我从未想到会重访的街巷
找到了我从未想说的话。
既然我们关心的是说话，而说话又驱使我们
去纯洁部族的方言
并怂恿我们瞻前顾后，
那么就让我打开长久保存的礼物
褒美你一生的成就。
首先，当肉体与灵魂开始分离时，
即将熄灭的感觉失去了魅力
它那冷漠的摩擦不能给你提供任何许诺
而只能是虚妄的果子的苦涩无味。
第二，是对人间的愚行自知表示愤怒的
软弱无力，以及对那不再引人发笑的一切
你的笑声受到的伤害。
最后，在重演你一生的作为和扮演的角色时
那撕裂心肺的痛苦；日后败露的动机所带来的羞愧，
还有你一度一位是行善之举，
如今觉察过去种种全是恶行
全是对别人的伤害而产生的内疚。
于是愚人的赞扬刺痛你，世间的荣誉玷污你。
激怒的灵魂从错误走向错误
除非得到炼火的匡救，因为像一个舞蹈家
你必然要随着节拍向那儿跳去。”
天色即将破晓。在这条毁损的街上
他带着永别的神情离开了我，
消失在汽笛的长鸣声中。

三

有三种情况发生在这同一片树篱，
往往貌似想像其实截然不同：
对自身、对物和人们的依附，
从自身、从物和人们的分离；以及在这两者之间
产生的冷漠，它与前两种相似，犹如死与生相似，
处于两种生涯之间——不绽开花朵，处于
生的和死的苦恼之间。这正是记忆的用处：
为了解脱——不是因为爱得不够
而是爱超乎欲望之外的扩展，于是不仅从过去
也从未来得到解脱。这样，对一个地方的爱恋
始于我们对自己的活动场所的依附
终于发现这种活动没多大意义
虽然决不是冷漠。历史也许是奴役，
历史也许是自由。瞧，那一张张脸一处处地方
随着那尽其是能爱过它们的自我
一起，现在它们都消失了，
而在另一种模式下更新，变化。

罪是不可避免的，但是
一切终将安然无恙，而且
时间万物也终将安然无恙。
如果我又一次想起这个地方，
又一次想起那些人，他们并非全都值得称道，
既非直系亲属也非性情和善之辈，
却是一些具有特殊才能的人，
他们都受了一种共同的思潮的感召，
而联合在把他们分裂为营垒的斗争中；
如果我在黄昏时分想起一位国王，
想起三个和更多的人被处决在绞刑架上
还有一些死后默默无闻的人
在其他地方，在这里和国外，
我也想起一个双目失明悄然死去的人，
为什么我们纪念这些死去的人
就该胜于纪念那些濒临死亡的人呢？
这不是重新去敲响往昔的钟声
也不是召唤一朵玫瑰的幽灵的咒语。
我们无法复活那些古老的派别
我们无法恢复那些古老的政策
或者跟上一面古老的皮鼓敲击的鼓点。
这些人，和反对他们的那些人
和那些他们反对的人
如今都接受了无声的命令
归入一个单一的团体。
不管我们重幸运的人们继承到什么

我们已经从失败的人们取得了
他们不得不留给我们的一切——一种象征：
一种在死亡中得到完善的象征。
因此，通过动机的纯化
凭着我们祈求的理由
一切终将安然无恙，而且
时间万物也终将安然无恙。

四

鸽子喷吐着炽烈的恐怖的火焰
划破夜空，掠飞而下
烈焰的火舌昭吿世间
它免除了死者的过错和罪愆。
那仅有的希望，要不就是失望
在于你对焚尸柴堆的选择或者就在于柴堆——
通过烈火从烈火中得到涤罪。

是谁想出这种折磨的呢？是爱。
爱是不熟悉的名字
它在编织火焰之衫的那双手后面，
火焰使人无法忍耐

那衣衫绝非人力所能解开。
我们只是活着，只是悲叹
不是让这种火就是让那种火把我们的生命耗完。

五

我们叫做开始的往往就是结束
而宣告结束也就是着手开始。
终点是我们出发的地方。每个短语
和每个句子只要安排妥帖（每个词都各得其所，
从它所处的位置支持其他的词，
文字既不羞怯也不炫耀，
新与旧之间的一种轻松的交流，
普通的文字确切而不鄙俗，
规范的文字准确而不迂腐，
融洽无间地在一起舞蹈）
那么每个短语每个句子都是一个结束和一个开始，
每首诗都是一篇墓志铭。而任何一个行动
都是走向断头台，走向烈火，落入大海
或走向一块你无法辨认的石碑的一步：
而这就是我们出发的地方，
我们与濒临死亡的人们偕亡：
瞧，他们离去了，我们与他们同行。
我们与死者同生：
瞧，他们回来了，携我们与他们俱来。
玫瑰飘香和紫杉扶疏的时令
经历的时间一样短长。一个没有历史的民族
不能从时间得到拯救，因为历史
是无始无终的瞬间的一种模式，所以，当一个冬天的下午
天色渐渐暗淡的时候，在一座僻静的教堂里
历史就是现在和英格兰。

由于这种爱和召唤声的吸引
我们将不停止探索
而我们一切探索的终点
将是到达我们出发的地方
并且是生平第一遭知道这地方。
当时间的终极犹待我们去发现的时候
穿过那未认识的，忆起的大门
就是过去曾经是我们的起点；
在最漫长的大河的源头
有深藏的瀑布的飞湍声
在苹果林中有孩子们的欢笑声，
这些你都不知道，因为你
并没有去寻找
而只是听到，隐约听到，
在大海两次潮汐之间的寂静里。
倏忽易逝的现在，这里，现在，永远——
一种极其简单的状态
（要求付出的代价却不比任何东西少）
而一切终将安然无恙，
时间万物也终将安然无恙
当火舌最后交织成牢固的火焰
烈火与玫瑰化为一体的时候。

Four Quartets : East Coker

I

In my beginning is my end. In succession
Houses rise and fall, crumble, are extended,
Are removed, destroyed, restored, or in their place
Is an open field, or a factory, or a by-pass.
Old stone to new building, old timber to new fires,
Old fires to ashes, and ashes to the earth
Which is already flesh, fur and faeces,
Bone of man and beast, cornstalk and leaf.
Houses live and die: there is a time for building
And a time for living and for generation
And a time for the wind to break the loosened pane
And to shake the wainscot where the field-mouse trots
And to shake the tattered arras woven with a silent motto.

In my beginning is my end. Now the light falls
Across the open field, leaving the deep lane
Shuttered with branches, dark in the afternoon,
Where you lean against a bank while a van passes,
And the deep lane insists on the direction
Into the village, in the electric heat
Hypnotised. In a warm haze the sultry light
Is absorbed, not refracted, by grey stone.
The dahlias sleep in the empty silence.
Wait for the early owl.
　　　　　　　　　　　　In that open field
If you do not come too close, if you do not come too close,
On a summer midnight, you can hear the music
Of the weak pipe and the little drum
And see them dancing around the bonfire
The association of man and woman
In daunsinge, signifying matrimonie -
A dignified and commodious sacrament.
Two and two, neccesarye conjunction,
Holding eche other by the hand or the arm
Whiche betokeneth concorde. Round and round the fire
Leaping through the flames, or joined in circles,
Rustically solemn or in rustic laughter
Lifting heavy feet in clumsy shoes,
Earth feet, loam feet, lifted in country mirth
Mirth of those long since under earth
Nourishing the corn, Keeping time,
Keeping the rhythm in their dancing
As in their living in the living seasons
The time of the seasons and the constellations
The time of milking and the time of harvest
The time of the coupling of man and woman
And that of beasts. Feet rising and falling,
Eating and drinking. Dung and death.

Dawn points, and another day
Prepares for heat and silence. Out at sea the dawn wind
Wrinkles and slides. I am here
Or there, or elsewhere. In my beginning.

II

What is the late November doing
With the disturbance of the spring
And creatures of the summer heat,
And snowdrops writhing under feet
And hollyhocks that aim too high
Red into grey and tumble down
Late roses filled with early snow?
Thunder rolled by the rolling stars
Simulates triumphal cars
Deployed in constellated wars
Scorpion fights against the Sun
Until the Sun and Moon go down
Comets weep and Leonids fly
Hunt the heavens and the plains
Whirled in a vortex that shall bring
The world to that destructive fire
Which burns before the ice-cap reigns.

That was a way of putting it - not very satisfactory:
A periphrastic study in a worn-out poetical fashion,
Leaving one still with the intolerable wrestle
With words and meanings. The poetry does not matter.
It was not (to start again) what one had expected.
What was to be the value of the long looked forward to,
Long hoped for calm, the autumnal serenity
And the wisdom of age? Had they deceived us
Or deceived themselves, the quiet-voiced elders,
Bequeathing us merely a receipt for deceit?
The serenity only a deliberate hebetude,
The wisdom only the knowledge of dead secrets
Useless in the darkness into which they peered
Or from which they turned their eyes. There is, it seems to us,
At best, only a limited value
In the knowledge derived from experience.
The knowledge imposes a pattern, and falsifies,
For the pattern is new in every moment
And every moment is a new and shocking
Valuation of all we have been. We are only undeceived
Of that which, deceiving, could no longer harm.
In the middle, not only in the middle of the way
But all the way, in a dark wood, in a bramble,
On the edge of a grimpen, where there is no secure foothold,
And menaced by monsters, fancy lights,
Risking enchantment. Do not let me hear
Of the wisdom of old men, but rather of their folly,
Their fear of fear and frenzy, their fear of possession,
Of belonging to another, or to others, or to God.
The only wisdom we can hope to acquire
Is the wisdom of humility: humility is endless.

The houses are all gone under the sea.

The dancers are all gone under the hill.

III

O dark dark dark. They all go into the dark
The vast interstellar spaces, the vacant into the vacant,
The captains, merchant bankers, eminent men of letters,
The generous patrons of art, the statesmen and the rulers,
Distinguished civil servants, chairmen of many committees,
Industrial lords and petty contractors, all go into the dark,
And dark the Sun and Moon, and the Almanach de Gotha
And the Stock Exchange Gazette, the Directory of Directors,
And cold the sense and lost the motive of action.
And we all go with them, into the silent funeral,
Nobody's funeral, for there is no one to bury.
I said to my soul, be still, and let the dark come upon you
Which shall be the darkness of God. As, in a theatre,
The lights are extinguished, for the scene to be changed
With a hollow rumble of wings, with a movement of darkness on darkness,

And we know that the hills and the trees, the distant panorama
And the bold imposing fa?ade are all being rolled away -
Or as, when an underground train, in the tube, stops too
long between stations
And the conversation rises and slowly fades into silence
And you see behind every face the mental emptiness deepen
Leaving only the growing terror of nothing to think about;
Or when, under ether, the mind is conscious but conscious of nothing -

I said to my soul, be still, and wait without hope
For hope would be hope for the wrong thing; wait without love
For love would be love of the wrong thing; there is yet faith
But the faith and the love and the hope are all in the waiting.
Wait without thought, for you are not ready for thought:
So the darkness shall be the light, and the stillness the dancing.

Whisper of running streams, and winter lightning.
The wild thyme unseen and the wild strawberry,
The laughter in the garden, echoed ecstasy
Not lost, but requiring, pointing to the agony
Of death and birth.
　　　　　　　　　　You say I am repeating
Something I have said before. I shall say it again.
Shall I say it again? In order to arrive there,
To arrive where you are, to get from where you are not,
You must go by a way wherein there is no ecstasy.
In order to arrive at what you do not know
You must go by a way which is the way of ignorance.
In order to possess what you do not possess
You must go by the way of dispossession.
In order to arrive at what you are not
You must go by the way in which you are not.
And what you do not know is the only thing you know
And what you own is what you do not own
And where you are is where you are not.

IV

The wounded surgeon plies the steel
That questions the distempered part;
Beneath the bleeding hands we feel
The sharp compassion of the healer's art.
Resolving the enigma of the fever chart.

Our only health is the disease
If we obey the dying nurse
Whose constant care is not to please
But to remind of our, and Adam's curse,
And that, to be restored, our sickness must grow worse.

The whole earth is our hospital
Endowed by the ruined millionaire,
Wherein, if we do well, we shall
Die of the absolute paternal care
That will not leave us, but prevents us everywhere.

The chill ascends from feet to knees,
The fever sings in mental wires.
If to be warmed, then I must freeze
And quake in frigid purgatorial fires
Of which the flame is roses, and the smoke is briars.

The dripping blood our only drink,
The bloody flesh our only food:
In spite of which we like to think
That we are sound, substantial flesh and blood -
Again, in spite of that, we call this Friday good.

V

So here I am, in the middle way, having had twenty years -
Twenty years largely wasted, the years of l'entre deux guerres -
Trying to learn to use words, and every attempt
Is a wholly new start, and a different kind of failure
Because one has only learnt to get the better of words
For the thing one no longer has to say, or the way in which
One is no longer disposed to say it. And so each venture
Is a new beginning, a raid on the inarticulate
With shabby equipment always deteriorating
In the general mess of imprecision of feeling,
Undisciplined squads of emotion. And what there is to conquer
By strength and submission, has already been discovered
Once or twice, or several times, by men whom one cannot hope
To emulate - but there is no competition -
There is only the fight to recover what has been lost
And found and lost again and again: and now, under conditions
That seem unpropitious. But perhaps neither gain nor loss.
For us, there is only the trying. The rest is not our business.

Home is where one starts from. As we grow older
The world becomes stranger, the pattern more complicated
Of dead and living. Not the intense moment
Isolated, with no before and after,
But a lifetime burning in every moment
And not the lifetime of one man only
But of old stones that cannot be deciphered.
There is a time for the evening under starlight,
A time for the evening under lamplight
(The evening with the photograph album).
Love is most nearly itself
When here and now cease to matter.
Old men ought to be explorers
Here and there does not matter
We must be still and still moving
Into another intensity
For a further union, a deeper communion
Through the dark cold and the empty desolation,
The wave cry, the wind cry, the vast waters
Of the petrel and the porpoise. In my end is my beginning.

二、东科克

一

在我的开始中是我的结束。隆替演变
屋宇建起又倒坍、倾圮又重新扩建，
迁移，毁坏，修复，或在原址
出现一片空旷的田野，或一座工厂，或一条间道。
旧石筑新楼，古木升新火，
旧火变灰烬，灰烬化黄土，
而黄土如今已化为肉，毛，粪，
人和兽的骨，麦秆和绿叶。
屋宇有生也有死：有建造的时候
也有供生活和蕃衍生息的时候，
有给大风吹落松弛的窗玻璃
摇动田鼠在来回奔驰的护壁板
吹起绣着沉默箴言的破挂毡的时候。

在我的开始中是我的结束。此刻阳光
掠过空旷的田野而隐去，留下深巷
任繁密的树叶把它掩住，你在暮色苍茫中
倚着岸堤，一辆货车从身边驶过，
深巷固执地向村里伸展，在炙人的暑热中
村子已摧入梦乡。在暖烘烘的氤氲里那燠热的光
被灰色的石头吸收了，而不是折射。
大丽花丛沉睡在空阒的寂静中。
等待着早来的枭鸟。
在空旷的田野
假如你不走得太近，假如你不走得太近，
在一个夏天的夜半，就就能听到
那轻柔的笛子和小鼓的音乐，
看见他们围着篝火跳舞，
男人和女人结对而舞，着是在举行婚礼——
一种庄严而方便的圣礼。
一双双一对对，必然的结合，
他们互相手拉手或臂膀挽着臂膀
表示情投意合。一圈又一圈地围着篝火
或加入舞伴们的圆圈，或穿过熊熊火焰
婆娑起舞，质朴而严肃，或发出村野的笑声
提起穿着笨拙的鞋子的沉重的脚，
泥脚，沾着沃土的脚、
沉浸在村野的欢乐——那久远以来
在地里滋育谷物的人们的欢乐之中。
他们按着生命的不同季节安排生活一样。
有四季更替和星辰出没的时间
有挤奶的时间和收获的时间
有男人和女人匹配成婚的时间
也有野兽交配的时间。两脚提起和放下。
吃和喝。拉撒和死亡。

东方破晓，另一个白天
又为炎热和寂静作准备。晨风在海上
吹起了波纹，掠海而去。我在这里
或在那里，或在别处。在我的开始中。

二

迟留的十一月
需要春天的困扰吗？
需要夏暑的创造物
和那脚下缠绕的雪花吗，
需要那一心想扶摇直上
却由红变灰终于跌落下来的蜀葵，
需要那盖满了初雪的凋零的玫瑰吗？
流驰的星星敲响了雷声隆隆
好似意气洋洋的战车
部署在群星会集的战斗中。
天蝎星攻打太阳
直打得太阳和月亮沉落
彗星暗暗哭泣而流星飞驰
追逐在一阵旋风中旋转的苍穹和大地
在冰雪君临大地之前旋风就将世界
卷向燃烧着的毁灭之火。

这不失为一种表达方式——但不太令人满意：
用一种陈旧的诗歌形式进行一次转弯抹角的研究，
而把人们始终留在一场跟语言和涵义
作无法容忍的扭打中。诗歌无关宗旨。
这并不是（重新开始）人们过去所期待的。
人们多年期待的东西，它的价值将是什么，
多年企望的平静，秋天般的平静
和老年的睿智，这一切又将有什么价值？
音容消寂的前辈他们遗赠给我们的只是欺骗的诀窍，
他们是骗了我们还是骗了他们自己？
平静不过是一种有意的愚騃,
睿智不过是懂得一些已经失效的秘诀，
对他们在黑暗中窥视黑暗
或置黑暗于不顾都没有什么用处。
在我们看来，来自经验的知识
似乎只有一种有限的价值。
知识把一个模式强加于人，然后欺骗人，
因为模式在每一瞬间都是新的
而每一瞬间又都是对我们以往的一切
作出一次新的骇人的评价。我们只是因为欺骗
已不再能伤害我们，才没有受骗而已。

在人生的中途，不禁在旅程的中途
而且是全部历程，我们都在黑暗的森林中，荆棘中，
在沼泽的边缘，那里没有安全的落脚点
而且受到各种魔怪和虚幻的光明的威胁
引诱你去冒险。别让我听取
老年人的睿智，不如听他们的愚行，
他们对恐惧和狂乱的恐惧，他们对财产的恐惧，

对属于另一个人，属于别人或属于上帝的恐惧。
我们唯一能希冀获得的睿智
是谦卑的睿智：谦卑是永无止境的。

屋宇房舍都已沉入大海。

跳舞的人们都已长眠山下。

三

啊 黑暗 黑暗 黑暗。他们都走进了黑暗，
空虚的星际之间的空间，空虚进入空虚，
上校们，银行家们，知名的文学家们，
慷慨大度的艺术赞助人、政治家和统治者，
显要的文官们，形形色色的委员主席们，
工业巨子和卑微的承包商们都走进了黑暗，
太阳和月亮也暗淡无光了，哥达年鉴
证券市场报和董事姓名录都黯然失色了，
感觉冷却，行动的动机也已经消失。
于是我们大家和他们同行，走进肃穆的葬礼，
不是谁的葬礼，因为没有谁要埋葬。
我对我的灵魂说，别作声，让黑暗降临在你的身上
这准是上帝的黑暗。正如在剧场里
为了变换场景，灯光熄灭了，
舞台两厢一阵沉重的辘辘声，在黑暗里
随着一番黑暗的动作，我们知道
群山，树林，远处的活动画景
还有那显目而堂皇的正面装设都在移走——
或者象一列地铁火车，在地道里，在车站与车站之间停得太久
旅客们交谈之声纷起，又逐渐消寂于静默，
而你在每张脸孔后面看到内心的空虚正在加深
只留下没有什么可想的恐惧在心头升起；
或者像上了麻醉以后，头脑清醒却无所感觉——
我对我的灵魂说，别作声，耐心等待但不要寄予希望，
因为希望会变成对虚妄的希望；
耐心等待但不要怀有爱恋，
因为爱恋会变成对虚妄的爱恋；纵然犹有信心，
但是信心、爱和希望都在等待之中。
耐心等待但不要思索，因为你还没有准备好思索：
这样黑暗必将变得光明，静止也将变成舞蹈。

潺潺的溪水在低语，冬天有雷电闪烁。
野百合花和野草莓没有被人赏识，
花园里那曾回想过当年狂喜的笑声
如今尤未消寂，但是在要求并暗示
死亡与降生的痛苦。
你说我是在重复
我以前说过的话。我还要再说一遍。
要我再说一遍吗？为了要到达那儿，
到达现在你所在的地方，离开现在你不在的地方，
你必须经历一条其中并无引人入胜之处的道路。
为了最终理解你所不理解的，
你必须经历一条愚昧无知的道路。
为了占有你从未占有的东西，
你必须经历被剥夺的道路。

为了达到你现在所不在的名位，
你必须经历那条你不在其中的道路。
你所不了解的正是你所唯一了解的，
而你所拥有的正是你所并不拥有的，
而你所在的地方也正是你所不在的地方。

四

受伤的医生挥动着钢刀
细心探究发病的部位；
在流血的双手下我们感觉到

医生满怀强烈同情的技艺
在揭开体温图表上的谜。
我们仅有的健康是疾病
如果我们听从那位垂危的护士——
她坚定不移的关注不是使我们欢欣
而是提醒我们和亚当蒙受的灾祸，
一旦灾祸重临，我们的病必将变为沉疴。

整个世界是我们的医院
由那个不幸的百万富翁资助，

在那里，如果我们的病况好转，
我们就将死于专制的父爱的关注，
它须臾不离引导着我们，不论我们身在何处。
冷意从两脚间升向膝盖，

热度在精神的弦线中歌词。
如果使我暖和起来，那么，我准会在
寒冷的地狱之火中站立而冻僵，
炼火的烈焰是玫瑰，而浓烟是多刺的荆棘。

滴出的血是我们唯一的饮料，
血腥的肉是我们唯一的食粮，
即使这样，我们仍然乐于称道
我们是有血有肉的人，结实而又健康——
同样，尽管如此，我们称道这个星期五好。

五

我就在这里，在旅程的中途，已经有二十年——
二十个大半虚度的年月，介于两次大战的年月——
试着学会使用语言，而每一次尝试
都是一次完全新的开始，也是一次性质不同的失败，
因为你不过是为了叙述那已经不必再叙述
或者你已经不想再那样叙述的事情
而学习怎样驾御语言的。所以每次冒险从事
都是一次新的开始，一次用破敝的装备
向无法言述的事物发动的袭击，最后总是溃不成军
只留下不准确的感觉乱作一团，
一群没有纪律的激情的乌合之众。
而那需要你用气力和谦逊去征服的一切，
早已被那些你无法企及的人们
一次或两次，或好多次所发现——但是没有竞争——
只有去找回那已经失去的东西，
但一旦找到又重新失去，又去寻找，
这样循环反复的斗争。而现在似乎处于
不利的条件之下。但也许既无所得也无所失。
对于我们，唯有尝试自己，此外则非我们所能为力。

家是我们出发的地方。随着我们年岁渐老
世界变为陌路人，死与生的模式更为复杂。
那已与我们隔绝——没有以前也没有以后的，
不是那感情强烈的瞬间，而是每瞬间都在燃烧的一生，
不仅是一个人的一生，而且也是
那些如今无法辨认的古老石碑的一生。
有在星光下的黄昏时刻，
有在灯光下的黄昏时刻
（在灯下翻阅相片薄的黄昏）。
为此时此地无关紧要之际，
爱最近乎它自己。
老年人应该是探索者，
此地或彼地无关大局，
我们必须静静地继续前进，
越过黑暗的寒冷和空阒无人的废墟，
越过波涛的呼啸，大封的怒号，
海鸟和海豚的浩淼大海，进入另一个感情的强度，
为了获得更进一步的一致，更深入的交流。
在我的结束中是我的开始。

Four Quartets : The Dry Salvages

I

I do not know much about gods; but I think that the river
Is a strong brown god - sullen, untamed and intractable,
Patient to some degree, at first recognised as a frontier;
Useful, untrustworthy, as a conveyor of commerce;
Then only a problem confronting the builder of bridges.
The problem once solved, the brown god is almost forgotten
By the dwellers in cities - ever, however, implacable,
Keeping his seasons and rages, destroyer, reminder
Of what men choose to forget. Unhonoured, unpropitiated
By worshippers of the machine, but waiting, watching and waiting.
His rhythm was present in the nursery bedroom,
In the rank ailanthus of the April dooryard,,
In the smell of grapes on the autumn table,
And the evening circle in the winter gaslight.
The river is with us, the sea is all about us;
The sea is the land's edge also, the granite
Into which it reaches, the beaches where it tosses
Its hints of earlier and other creation:
The starfish, the horseshoe crab, the whale's backbone;
The pools where it offers to our curiosity
The more delicate algae and the sea anemone.
It tosses up our losses, the torn seine,
The shattered lobsterpot, the broken oar
And the gear of foreign dead men. The sea has many
voices,
Many gods and many voices.
The salt is on the
briar rose,
The fog is in the fir trees.
The sea howl
And the sea yelp, are different voices
Often together heard: the whine in the rigging,
The menace and caress of wave that breaks on water,
The distant rote in the granite teeth,
And the wailing warning from the approaching headland
Are all sea voices, and the heaving groaner
Rounded homewards, and the seagull:
And under the oppression of the silent fog
The tolling bell
Measures time not our time, rung by the unhurried
Ground swell, a time
Older than the time of chronometers, older
Than time counted by anxious worried women
Lying awake, calculating the future,
Trying to unweave, unwind, unravel
And piece together the past and the future,
Between midnight and dawn, when the past is all deception,
The future futureless, before the morning watch
When time sops and time is never ending;
And the ground swell, that is and was from the beginning,
Clangs
The bell.

II

Where is there an end of it, the soundless wailing,
The silent withering of autumn flowers
Dropping their petals and remaining motionless;
Where is there an end to the drifting wreckage,
The prayer of the bone on the beach, the unprayable
Prayer at the calamitous annunciation?

There is no end, but addition: the trailing

Consequence of further days and hours,
While emotion takes to itself the emotionless
Years of living among the breakage
Of what was believed in as the most reliable -
And therefore the fittest for renunciation.

There is the final addition, the failing
Pride or resentment at failing powers,
The unattached devotion which might pass for devotionless,
In a drifting boat with a slow leakage,
The silent listening to the undeniable
Clamour of the bell of the last annunciation.

Where is the end of them, the fishermen sailing
Into the wind's tail, where the fog cowers?
We cannot think of a time that is oceanless
Or of an ocean not littered with wastage
Or of a future that is not liable
Like the past, to have no destination.

We have to think of them as forever bailing,
Setting and hauling, while the North East lowers
Over shallow banks unchanging and erosionless
Or drawing their money, drying sails at dockage;
Not as making a trip that will be unpayable
For a haul that will not bear examination.

There is no end of it, the voiceless wailing,
No end to the withering of withered flowers,
To the movement of pain that is painless and motionless,
To the drift of the sea and the drifting wreckage,
The bone's prayer to Death its God. Only the hardly, barely
prayable
Prayer of the one Annunciation.

It seems, as one becomes older,
That the past has another pattern, and ceases to be a mere
sequence -
Or even development: the latter a partial fallacy
Encouraged by superficial notions of evolution,
Which becomes, in the popular mind, a means of disowning
the past.
The moments of happiness - not the sense of well-being,
Fruition, fulfilment, security or affection,
Or even a very good dinner, but the sudden illumination -
We had the experience but missed the meaning,
And approach to the meaning restores the experience
In a different form, beyond any meaning
We can assign to happiness. I have said before
That the past experience revived in the meaning
Is not the experience of one life only
But of many generations - not forgetting
Something that is probably quite ineffable:
The backward look behind the assurance
Of recorded history, the backward half-look
Over the shoulder, towards the primitive terror.
Now, we come to discover that the moments of agony
(Whether, or not, due to misunderstanding,
Having hoped for the wrong things or dreaded the wrong
things,
Is not in question) are likewise permanent
With such permanence as time has. We appreciate this better
In the agony of others, nearly experienced,
Involving ourselves, than in our own.
For our own past is covered by the currents of action,
But the torment of others remains an experience
Unqualified, unworn by subsequent attrition.
People change, and smile: but the agony abides.
Time the destroyer is time the preserver,
Like the river with its cargo of dead negroes, cows and chicken coops,
The bitter apple and the bite in the apple.
And the ragged rock in the restless waters,
Waves wash over it, fogs conceal it;
On a halcyon day it is merely a monument,
In navigable weather it is always a seamark
To lay a course by: but in the sombre season
Or the sudden fury, is what it always was.

III

I sometimes wonder if that is what Krishna meant -
Among other things - or one way of putting the same thing:
That the future is a faded song, a Royal Rose or a lavender spray
Of wistful regret for those who are not yet here to regret,
Pressed between yellow leaves of a book that has never been opened.
And the way up is the way down, the way forward is the way back.
You cannot face it steadily, but this thing is sure,
That time is no healer: the patient is no longer here.
When the train starts, and the passengers are settled
To fruit, periodicals and business letters
(And those who saw them off have left the platform)
Their faces relax from grief into relief,
To the sleepy rhythm of a hundred hours.
Fare forward, travellers! not escaping from the past

Into different lives, or into any future;
You are not the same people who left that station
Or who will arrive at any terminus,
While the narrowing rails slide together behind you;
And on the deck of the drumming liner
Watching the furrow that widens behind you,
You shall not think 'the past is finished'
Or 'the future is before us'.
At nightfall, in the rigging and the aerial,
Is a voice descanting (though not to the ear,
The murmuring shell of time, and not in any language)
'Fare forward, you who think you are voyaging;
You are not those who saw the harbour
Receding, or those who will disembark.
Here between the hither and the farther shore
While time is withdrawn, consider the future
And the past with an equal mind.
At the moment which is not of action or inaction
You can receive this: "on whatever sphere of being
The mind of a man may be intent
At the time of death" - that is the one action
(And the time of death is every moment)
Which shall fructify in the lives of others:
And do not think of the fruit of action.
Fare forward.
O voyagers, O seamen,
You who come to port, and you whose bodies
Will suffer the trial and judgement of the sea
Or whatever event, this is your real destination.'
So Krishna, as when he admonished Arjuna
On the field of battle.
Not fare well,
But fare forward, voyagers.

IV

Lady, whose shrine stands on the promontory,
Pray for all those who are in ships, those
Whose business has to do with fish, and
Those concerned with every lawful traffic
And those who conduct them.
Repeat a prayer also on behalf of
Women who have seen their sons or husbands
Setting forth, and not returning:
Figlia del tuo figlio,
Queen of Heaven.

Also pray for those who were in ships, and
Ended their voyage on the sand, in the sea's lips
Or in the dark throat which will not reject them
Or wherever cannot reach them the sound of the sea bell's
Perpetual angelus.

V

To communicate with Mars, converse with spirits,
To report the behaviour of the sea monster,
Describe the horoscope, haruspicate or scry,
Observe disease in signatures, evoke
Biography from the wrinkles of the palm
And tragedy from fingers; release omens
By sortilege, or tea leaves, riddle the inevitable
With playing cards, fiddle with pentagrams
Or barbituric acids, or dissect
The recurrent image into pre-conscious terrors -
To explore the womb, or tomb, or dreams; all these are usual
Pastimes and drugs, and features of the press:
And always will be, some of them especially
When there is distress of nations and perplexity
Whether on the shores of Asia, or in the Edgware Road.
Men's curiosity searches past and future
And clings to that dimension. Bur to apprehend
The point of intersection of the timeless
With time, is and occupation for the saint -
No occupation either, but something given
And taken, in a lifetime's death in love,
Ardour and selflessness and self-surrender.
For most of us, there is only the unattended
Moment, the moment in and out of time,
The distraction fit, lost in a shaft of sunlight,
The wild thyme unseen, or the winter lightning
Or the waterfall, or music heard so deeply
That it is not heard at all, but you are the music

While the music lasts. These are only hints and guesses,
Hints followed by guesses; and the rest
Is prayer, observance, discipline, thought and action.
The hint half guessed, the gift half understood, is Incarnation.
Here the impossible union
Of spheres of existence is actual,
Here the past and future
Are conquered, and reconciled,
Where action were otherwise movement
Of that which is only moved
And has in it no source of movement -
Driven by d?monic, chthonic
Powers. And right action is freedom
From past and future also.
For most of us, this is the aim
Never here to be realised;
Who are only undefeated
Because we have gone on trying;
We, content at the last
If our temporal reversion nourish
(Not too far from the yew-tree)
The life of significant soil.

三、干燥的萨尔维吉斯

一

我不太了解神明；但我以为这条河
准是个威武的棕色大神——阴沉，粗野而又倔强，
忍耐只能到一定侧过年度，起初人们把他认作一条边界；
有用，但不值得信赖，像是个商业的运输人；
此后只成了桥梁建造则面临的一个问题。
问题一旦解决，这个棕色大神就几乎
被城市的居民淡忘——尽管他依然难以平息，
保持着他的四季和愤怒，作为破坏者，作为唤起
人们但愿忘怀的过去的提示者。得不到机器
崇拜者的尊敬和抚慰，只是等待着，守望着，等待着。
他的律动出现在托儿所的卧室里，
出现在四月庭院中繁茂的埃朗萨斯树丛里，
出现的秋天餐桌上葡萄的芳香里，
和在冬天夜晚煤气灯的光圈里。

河在我们中间，海在我们周围；
海也是大地的边缘，它波涛滚滚
拍向花岗岩，它把暗示它在远古和不久前的创造
星星点点地抛向岸滩：
星鱼，鲎，鲸鱼的脊骨；
在水潭里，它给我们的好奇心
留下了更纤巧的海藻和海葵。
它抛起我们失落的东西，那破烂的渔网，
捕捉龙虾的破篓，折断的船桨
和异域死者的褴褛的衣衫。海有很多种声音，
很多神明和很多声音。
盐在多刺的玫瑰上，
雾在冷杉树林中。
大海的嚎叫
和大海的呼喊，是不同的声音
常常能同时听到；帆索的哀鸣声，
海面上巨浪翻滚的恐吓和爱抚，
远处的惊涛在花岗岩的齿缝中的排击声，
还有为海岬逼近而发出的警告的呜咽声，
这些斗士大海的声音，还有掉头朝向归途的
发出尖啸声的浮标和海鸥：
在悄无生息的浓雾的压力下
那从容不迫的巨浪敲响了
隆隆钟声，报告着时间，但不是我们的时间，
一种时间
比天文钟计量的时间更古老，
比那些烦恼而焦虑不安的女人们计算的时间更古老，
她们长夜不寐，计算着未来，
试着把过去和未来拆散，解开，
又把它们重新拼合在一起，
在夜半和黎明之间，当过去已变为一场欺骗，
未来已成为没有未来，在四更之前
时间停歇，时间变成永无终了的时候；
巨浪滔滔，现在是这样，有始以来也是这样。
钟声
铿锵

二

这无声的呜咽，这秋花的悄然谢去，
花瓣飘落从此凝然不动，它们的终极在哪里？
沉船的残骸随波漂泊，白骨在岸滩上祈求，
那向宣布灾难临头的通告
发出无从祈求的祈求，，
这一切的终极在哪里？

一切了无终极，不禁如此更有那
随未来的时日而接触而来的后果，
当人生的无情岁月已落入你一度以为
最可信赖的事物的碎片之中——
因而最恰当的对策莫如舍弃的时候，
感情却兀自沉湎于往昔。

最后还有出于对自己的气力不济
而产生无济于事的自豪和怨恨；
驾一叶小舟漂泊海上，任凭海水从裂隙徐徐漏入，
那无所依附的眷恋可能北看作无所眷恋；
还有那最后的通告的钟声发出不可争辩的呼喊时
默默无语的谛听。

何处是渔夫的归宿，他们驶进
风的尾势，雾霭在那里瑟瑟颤抖？
我们无法想象一个没有海洋的时代
或者一个不是漂满了废物的海洋
或者一个不可能有一个目的地的未来，
像过去的岁月那样。
我们应该想起他们一如既往在戽水，
在张网和拉网，当那东北风势减弱吹过
永不变化也永不销蚀的浅提，
或者在船坞领取鱼钱，晒晾风帆；
而不应该想象他们在作一次毫无收益的出航，
打一网经不起审查的捕捞。

那无声的呜咽永无穷期，
那秋花的谢去，没有痛苦也没有运动的痛苦的运动，
海的冲卷和漂流的沉船残骸，
白骨向它的上帝死神的祈求，这一切都永无穷期。
只有圣母报喜节那一声几乎是不可能
却又是唯一苦难祈求的祈求。

当你年岁渐老，那过去
仿佛已有了另一种模式，不再只是一个结果——
或者甚至是一种发展：后者是部分的谬误，
受到肤浅的进化论思想的怂恿，
而在常人的心目中变成否认自己的过去的一种手段。
赏心乐事的瞬间——不是康泰之感，
功成名就，夙愿已偿，无忧无虑或感受到亲人之爱，
甚至不是享用一顿丰美酒宴，而是猛地或然彻悟——
我们有过这种经验，但没有领会其中涵义，
而懂得涵义就是在我们能赋予幸福以任何意义之外
在不同的形式中恢复以往的经验。我以前说过
在涵义中复活的以往经验
不仅是一个人一生的经验，
而且是多少世代人的经验——不要忘记
其中有的很可能根本无法言喻：
返顾典籍记载的历史的信念后面，
回转头去，只须稍稍返顾一下，
就看到那远古的恐怖。
现在，我们终于发现痛苦的瞬间
（至于是否出于误解，我们一向
寄希望于虚妄，或畏惧于不当畏惧的，
在不是我们要谈的问题）都与时间所具有的永恒性
一样永恒。在一点我们在别人的（与我们有关，
几乎像我们身受的一样）痛苦中领会得更深。
因为我们自己的过去被行动和汹涌的激流淹没了，
而别人的苦恼却始终是一种经验，
确凿无疑而又不为接踵而来的时间所磨损。
人们变化，微笑，而痛苦常在。
时间这个破坏者也是时间这个保存者，
就像这条运载死亡的黑人、牛棚和鸡笼的河，
就像苦涩的苹果和苹果上留下的齿痕一样。
而嶙峋的礁石在永不宁息的流水中
浪花冲刷它，浓雾掩蔽它；
风平浪静的日子，它不过是一块标石，
在适宜航行的气候永远是一个确定
航道的航海标志，但当阴沉忧郁的季节
或当它暴怒的时候，就露出了它本来的面目。

三

我有时怀疑克里希纳说的是否就是这个意思——
在别种涵义之外——或者同一件事的另一种说法：
未来是一支消寂的歌，一朵殷红的玫瑰，或者是
一株为那些还没有到这里来表示悔恨的人们
留下的永志悔恨的薰衣草，
压在一本从未翻开却已发黄的书页之间。
而向上的路就是向下的路，向前的路就是回头的路。
你不能面对它而神色自若，但在件事却是确切无疑的，
时间不是治病的医生，病人已一去不复返。
当列车启动的时候，旅客们安顿下来
开始品尝水果、翻阅书刊和公务函件
（前来给他们送行的人们也离开了月台），
随着漫长时刻催人欲睡的节奏
他们的脸色从悲痛舒展为轻松。
旅人们，向前行进吧！在不是从过去
逃往不同的生活，也不是逃往任何未来；
你们不是刚才离开那个车站的人群
也不是行将到达终点的人们，
当渐行渐窄的铁轨在你们后面并成一线；
当你们的机声隆隆的轮船甲板上
谛视着船首劈开的波浪在你们后面扩展开去，
你们不会想到“往者已矣”
或者“来者可追”。
夜阑时分，在帆缆和天线里
有歌声在反复吟唱（虽然在低声细语的时间弦琴
既非为耳朵而弹奏，也未形之于任何语言）：
“向前行进吧，你们这些自以为在航海旅行的人；
你们不是那望见港湾渐渐消失的人们，
也不是行将离船上岸的人们。
这里，在海岸这边和更远的海岸之间，
当时间已经隐退，请用平等的心怀
思考过去和未来。
在这既不是行动也不是无所行动的瞬间
你们不妨听取这句忠告：‘在死亡的时刻
一个人不论他的意志专注什么样的
生存地位’——那是一次行动
（而死亡的时刻则是每一瞬间），
它必将在别人的生命中开花结果：
因此不必考虑行动的成果。
想前行进吧。
啊 航海的旅人们，啊 海员们
你们来到港口的人们，你们的身体将经受
大海的考验和判决或者不论遭到
什么事故的人们，这里就是你们真正的目的地。”
克里希纳就这样在战场上
劝告阿尔朱纳。
不是永别，
而是扬帆前行，航海的旅人们。

四

圣母啊，您的神殿屹立在海岬之上，
请您为所有船上的人们，
为那些以渔业为生涯的人们，
也为那些与一切合法的海上交通有关
以及指挥他们的人们祈祷吧。

请您也为那些送别了儿子或丈夫
启程出海，他们还没有回家的女人们
再作一次祈祷吧：
Figlia del tuo figlio，
天国之后。

也为那些曾在船上，却在沙滩上，在大海的嘴唇里
或在那来者不拒的黑暗的喉咙里
或不论何处，只要是永恒的天使敲响
大海的钟声传不到他们的地方
最后终止了航行的人们祈祷吧。

五

跟火星通话，与神灵交谈，
报告海妖的行为，
观测天象预卜未来，查看祭牲的内脏以释神谕，
或从水晶球中观察幻象，
从签名的笔迹看出病症，从手掌的纹路
追溯身世经历和从手指想起悲惨不幸；
用签卜或茶叶祛除凶兆，用纸牌解释
不可避免的事故，揣摩五角星形的图象
或靠服巴比妥酸打发日子，或把反复出现的想象
解析为前意识的各种恐惧——
由此探索出生、死亡或梦境；所有这些
都是平素的消遣和药物、报刊的特写报道，
而且也将永远如此，其中有些尤其如此，
当国家陷入危难和困惑不决的时候，
不论是在亚洲的海岸还是在艾琪韦尔大街。
人们的好奇心总爱探究过去和未来，
而且在这方面锲而不舍。但是领悟
那无始无终与时间的交叉点，却是圣者的职业——
也不是职业，而是他们为了爱、热忱、无私和自我屈从
而殉道的一生中的一种给予和取受。
就我们多数人来说，我们有的不过是被我们虚度的
瞬间，在时间之内和时间之外的瞬间，
不过是一次消失在一道阳光之中的心烦意乱，
没有被人赏识的野百合花香，或是冬天的闪电
或是飞溅的瀑布，或是听得过于深切
而一无所闻的音乐，但是只要乐曲余音未绝，
你就是音乐。这些不过是暗示和猜测，
暗示后面跟着猜测；其余就是
祈求，遵奉，修持，思索和行动。
猜出一半的暗示，懂得一半的赠予，是基督化为人身。
这里，各种生存地位不可能取得一致
是确实无疑的，
这里，过去和未来
已被征服，并且获得和解，
在这里行动不过是目前被驱动的事物的另一种运动，
运动的始源并不在于它本身之内——
而是受魔鬼的力量，地下的
力量的推动。而正当的行动
也不受过去与未来的约束。
对我们多数人来说，这是决不可能
在这里实现的目标；
我们仅仅是没有被击败而已，
因为我们还在继续尝试；
如果我们的暂时返归本源能滋育
（离紫杉树并不太远）
那意义深长的土地的生命，
我们，终将感到心满意足。

Four Quartets : Little Gidding

I

Midwinter spring is its own season
Sempiternal though sodden towards sundown,
Suspended in time, between pole and tropic.
When the short day is brightest, with frost and fire,
The brief sun flames the ice, on pond and ditches,
In windless cold that is the heart's heat,
Reflecting in a watery mirror
A glare that is blindness in the early afternoon.
And glow more intense than blaze of branch, or brazier,
Stirs the dumb spirit: no wind, but pentecostal fire
In the dark time of the year. Between melting and freezing
The soul's sap quivers. There is no earth smell
Or smell of living thing. This is the spring time
But not in time's covenant. Now the hedgerow
Is blanched for an hour with transitory blossom
Of snow, a bloom more sudden
Than that of summer, neither budding nor fading,
Not in the scheme of generation.
Where is the summer, the unimaginable
Zero summer?
If you came this way,
Taking the route you would be likely to take
From the place you would be likely to come from,
If you came this way in may time, you would find the hedges
White again, in May, with voluptuary sweetness.
It would be the same at the end of the journey,
If you came at night like a broken king,
If you came by day not knowing what you came for,
It would be the same, when you leave the rough road
And turn behind the pig- sty to the dull fa?ade
And the tombstone. And what you thought you came for
Is only a shell, a husk of meaning
From which the purpose breaks only when it is fulfilled
If at all. Either you had no purpose
Or the purpose is beyond the end you figured
And is altered in fulfilment. There are other places
Which also are the world's end, some at the sea jaws,
Or over a dark lake, in a desert or a city -
But this is the nearest, in place and time,
Now and in England.

If you came this way,
Taking any route, starting from anywhere,
At any time or at any season,
It would always be the same: you would have to put off
Sense and notion. You are not here to verify,
Instruct yourself, or inform curiosity
Or carry report. You are here to kneel
Where prayer has been valid. And prayer is more
Than an order of words, the conscious occupation
Of the praying mind, or the sound of the voice praying.
And what the dead had no speech for, when living,
They can tell you, being dead: the communication
Of the dead is tongued with fire beyond the language of the living.
Here, the intersection of the timeless moment
Is England and nowhere. Never and always.

II

Ash on an old man's sleeve
Is all the ash the burnt roses leave.
Dust in the air suspended
Marks the place where a story ended.
Dust inbreathed was a house -
The wall, the wainscot and the mouse.
The death of hope and despair,
This is the death of air.

There are flood and drouth
Over the eyes and in the mouth,
Dead water and dead sand
Contending for the upper hand.
The parched eviscerate soil
Gapes at the vanity of toil,
Laughs without mirth.
This is the death of earth.

Water and fire succeed
The town, the pasture and the weed.
Water and fire deride
The sacrifice that we denied.
Water and fire shall rot
The marred foundations we forgot,
Of sanctuary and choir.
This is the death of water and fire.

In the uncertain hour before the morning
Near the ending of interminable night
At the recurrent end of the unending
After the dark dove with the flickering tongue
Had passed below the horizon of his homing
While the dead leaves still rattled on like tin
Over the asphalt where no other sound was
Between three districts whence the smoke arose
I met one walking, loitering and hurried
As if blown towards me like the metal leaves
Before the urban dawn wind unresisting.
And as I fixed upon the down-turned face
That pointed scrutiny with which we challenge
The first-met stranger in the waning dusk
I caught the sudden look of some dead master
Whom I had known, forgotten, half recalled
Both one and many; in the brown baked features
The eyes of a familiar compound ghost
Both intimate and unidentifiable.
So I assumed a double part, and cried
And heard another's voice cry : 'What! are you here?'
Although we were not. I was still the same,
Knowing myself yet being someone other -
And he a face still forming; yet the words sufficed
To compel the recognition they preceded.
And so, compliant to the common wind,
Too strange to each other for misunderstanding,
In concord at this intersection time
Of meeting nowhere, no before or after,
We trod the pavement in a dead patrol.
I said: 'The wonder that I feel is easy,
Yet ease is cause of wonder. Therefore speak:
I may not comprehend, may not remember.'
And he: 'I am not eager to rehearse
My thought and theory which you have forgotten.
These things have served their purpose: let them be.
So with your own, and pray they be forgiven
By others, as I pray you to forgive
Both bad and good. Last season's fruit is eaten
And the fullfed beast shall kick the empty pail.
For last year's words belong to last year's language
And next year's words await another voice.
Bur, as the passage now presents no hindrance
To the spirit unappeased and peregrine
Between two worlds become much like each other,
So I find words I never thought to speak
In streets I never thought I should revisit
When I left my body on a distant shore.
Since our concern was speech, and speech impelled us
To purify the dialect of the tribe
And urge the mind to aftersight and foresight,
Let me disclose the gifts reserved for age
To set a crown upon your lifetime's effort.
First, the cold friction of expiring sense
Without enchantment, offering no promise
But bitter tastelessness of shadow fruit
As body and soul begin to fall asunder.
Second, the conscious impotence of rage
At human folly, and the laceration
Of laughter at what ceases to amuse.
And last, the rending pain of re-enactment
Of all that you have done, and been; the shame
Of motives late revealed, and the awareness
Of things ill done and done to others' harm
Which once you took for exercise of virtue.
Then fools' approval stings, and honour stains.
From wrong to wrong the exasperated spirit
Proceeds, unless restored by that refining fire
Where you must move in measure, like a dancer.'
The day was breaking. In the disfigured street
He left me, with a kind of valediction,
And faded on the blowing of the horn.

III

There are three conditions which often look alike
Yet differ completely, flourish in the same hedgerow:
Attachment of self and to things and to persons, detachment
From self and from things and from persons; and, growing
between them, indifference
Which resembles the others as death resembles life,
Being between two lives - unflowering, between
The live and the dead nettle. This is the use of memory:
For liberation - not less of love but expanding

Of love beyond desire, and so liberation
From the future as well as the past. Thus, love of a country
Begins as attachment to our own field of action
And comes to find that action of little importance
Though never indifferent. History may be servitude,
History may be freedom. See, now they vanish,
The faces and places, with the self which, as it could, loved
Them,
To become renewed, transfigured, in another pattern.
Sin is Behovely, but
All shall be well, and
All manner of thing shall be well.
If I think, again, of this place,
And of people, not wholly commendable,
Of no immediate kin or kindness,
But some of peculiar genius,
All touched by a common genius,
United in the strife which divided them;
If I think of a king at nightfall,
Of three men, and more, on the scaffold
And a few who died forgotten
In other places, here and abroad,
And of one who died blind and quiet
Why should we celebrate
These dead men more than the dying?
It is not to ring the bell backward
Nor is it an incantation
To summon the spectre of a Rose.
We cannot revive old factions
We cannot restore old policies
Or follow an antique drum.
These men, and those who opposed them
And those whom they opposed
Accept the constitution of silence
And are folded in a single party.
Whatever we inherit from the fortunate
We have taken from the defeated
What they had to leave us - a symbol:
A symbol perfected in death.
And all shall be well and
All manner of thing shall be well
By the purification of the motive
In the ground of our beseeching.

IV

The dove descending breaks the air
With flame of incandescent terror

Of which the tongues declare
The one discharge from sin and error.
The only hope, or else despair
Lies in the choice of pyre or pyre -
To be redeemed from fire by fire.

Who then devised the torment? Love.
Love is the unfamiliar Name
Behind the hands that wove
The intolerable shirt of flame
Which human power cannot remove.
We only live, only suspire
Consumed by either fire or fire.

V

What we call the beginning is often the end
And to make an end is to make a beginning.
The end is where we start from. And every phrase
And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,
Taking its place to support the others,
The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,
An easy commerce of the old and the new,
The common word exact without vulgarity,
The formal word precise but not pedantic,
The complete consort dancing together)
Every phrase and every sentence is an end and a beginning,
Every poem an epitaph. And any action
Is a step to the block, to the fire, down the sea's throat
Or to an illegible stone: and that is where we start.
We die with the dying:
See, they depart, and we go with them.
We are born with the dead:
See, they return, and bring us with them.
The moment of the rose and the moment of the yew-tree
Are of equal duration. A people without history
Is not redeemed from time, for history is a pattern
Of timeless moments. So, while the light fails
On a winter's afternoon, in a secluded chapel
History is now and England.

四、小吉丁

一

仲东的春天是它自己的季节
漫漫永昼而到日落却一片湿润，
悬在时间中，在极圈和回归线之间。
当短暂的白昼因为寒霜和火成为最明亮的时刻，
匆促的太阳点燃了地上和沟里的冰，
在无风的冷冽中那是心的热，
在一面似水的镜子里
映照出一道刺目的强光，
在就是晌午时分之所以令人眩目而一无所见。
灼热的光比柴枝的火更烈比火盆更旺，
激起麻木的精神：没有风，只有圣灵降临节的火
在这一年的黑暗时节。在融化和结冰之间
灵魂的活力在颤抖。没有大地的气息
或者有生命之物的气息。这是春天季节
但不是在约定的时间之内。现在树篱
因为雪花短暂开放而一时满身素白，
一次比夏花绽放更突然的花开，
既未含葩待放也不会凋零谢落，
不在世代蕃衍的计划之内。
夏天在哪里？那不可想象的
零度的夏天？

如果你到这里来，
选择你可能选择的路线
从你可能出那里来的地方来，
如果你在山楂花开的时候到这里来，
你会发现五月里，树篱又变白了，
飘散这迷人的甜香。
到旅程的终点都一样，
如果你像一位困顿的国王夤夜而来，
如果你白天来又不知道你为何而来，
那都一样，当你离开崎岖的小径
在猪栏后面拐向那阴暗的前庭和墓碑的时候。
你原先以为是你此行的目的
现在不过是意义的一层贝壳，一层荚
只要有什么目的能实现的话，目的才破壳而出。
或者是你原先根本没有目的
或者是目的在于你是想象的终点之外
而在实现的过程中已经改变。另有一些地方
也是世界的终点，有的在海的入口
或者在一片黑暗的湖上，在沙漠中
或者在一座城市里——
但是在地点和时间上，这里是最近的地方，
现在和在英格兰。

如果你到这里来，
不论走哪条路，从哪里出发，
在哪个地方或哪个季节，
那都是一样：你必须抛开
感觉和思想。你到这里来不是为了证明什么，
教诲自己，或者告诉什么新奇的事物
或者传送报告。你到这里来
是到祈祷一向是正当的地方来
俯首下跪。祈祷不只是
一种话语，祈祷者头脑的
清醒的活动，或者是祈求呼告的声音。
死者活着的时候，无法以言词表达的，
他们作为死者能告诉你：死者的交流思想
超乎生者的语言之外是用火表达的。
这里，无始无终的瞬间的交叉点是英格兰，
而不是任何其他地方。决不而且永远。

一个老人衣袖上的灰
是焚烧的玫瑰留下的全部尘灰。
尘灰悬在空中
标志着一个故事在这里告终。
你吸入的尘灰曾经是一座宅邸——
墙、护壁板和耗子。
希望和希望的死亡，
这是空气的死亡。

在眼睛之上，在嘴巴里
有洪水和干旱，
止水和死沙
在争斗着谁占上风。
坼裂的失去元气的泥土
张目结舌地望着徒然无益的劳动，
放声大笑而没有欢乐。
这是土的死亡。

水和火取代
城镇、牧场和野草。
水和火嘲弄
我们拒绝奉献的牺牲。
水和火也必将腐蚀
我们遗忘的圣殿和唱诗席的
已经毁坏的基础。
这是水和火的死亡。

在黎明来临前无法确知的时刻
漫漫长夜行将结束
永无终止又到了终点
当黑黝黝的鸽子喷吐着忽隐忽现的火舌
在地平线下掠飞归去以后
在硝烟升腾的三个地区之间
再没有别的声息只有枯叶像白铁皮一般
嘎嘎作响地扫过沥青路面
这时我遇见一个在街上闲荡的行人
像被不可阻挡的城市晨风吹卷的
金属薄片急匆匆地向我走来。
当我用锐利而审视的目光
打量他那张低垂的脸庞
就像我们盘问初次遇见的陌生人那样
在即将消逝的暮色中
我瞧见一位曾经相识、但已淡忘的已故的大师
突然显现的面容，我恍惚记得
他既是一个又是许多个；晒黒的脸上
一个熟识的复合的灵魂的眼睛
既亲密又不可辨认。
因此我反复了一个双重角色，一面喊叫
一面又听另一个人喊叫：“啊！你在这里？”
尽管我们都不是。我还是我，
但我知道我自己已经成了另一个人——
而他只是一张还在形成的脸；但语言已足够
强迫他们承认曾经相识。
因此，按照一般的风尚，
双方既然素昧平生也就不可能产生误会，
我们在这千载难逢，没有以前也没有以后的
交叉时刻和谐地漫步在行人道上作一次死亡的巡逻。
我说：“我感到惊异是那么轻松安适，
然而轻松正是惊异的原因。所以说，
我也许并不理解，也许不复记忆。”
他却说：“我的思想和原则已被你遗忘，
我不想再一次详细申诉。
这些东西已经满足了它们的需要：由它们去吧。
你自己的也是这样，祈求别人宽恕它们吧，
就像我祈求你宽恕善与恶一样。上季的果子
已经吃过，喂饱了的野兽也一定会把空桶踢开。
因为去年的话属于去年的语言
而来年的话还在等待另一种语调。
但是，对于来自异域没有得到抚慰的灵魂，
在两个已变得非常相像的世界之间
现在道路已畅通无阻，
所以当我把我的躯体
委弃在遥远的岸边以后
我在我从未想到会重访的街巷
找到了我从未想说的话。
既然我们关心的是说话，而说话又驱使我们
去纯洁部族的方言
并怂恿我们瞻前顾后，
那么就让我打开长久保存的礼物
褒美你一生的成就。
首先，当肉体与灵魂开始分离时，
即将熄灭的感觉失去了魅力
它那冷漠的摩擦不能给你提供任何许诺
而只能是虚妄的果子的苦涩无味。
第二，是对人间的愚行自知表示愤怒的
软弱无力，以及对那不再引人发笑的一切
你的笑声受到的伤害。
最后，在重演你一生的作为和扮演的角色时
那撕裂心肺的痛苦；日后败露的动机所带来的羞愧，
还有你一度一位是行善之举，
如今觉察过去种种全是恶行
全是对别人的伤害而产生的内疚。
于是愚人的赞扬刺痛你，世间的荣誉玷污你。
激怒的灵魂从错误走向错误
除非得到炼火的匡救，因为像一个舞蹈家
你必然要随着节拍向那儿跳去。”
天色即将破晓。在这条毁损的街上
他带着永别的神情离开了我，
消失在汽笛的长鸣声中。

有三种情况发生在这同一片树篱，
往往貌似想像其实截然不同：
对自身、对物和人们的依附，
从自身、从物和人们的分离；以及在这两者之间
产生的冷漠，它与前两种相似，犹如死与生相似，
处于两种生涯之间——不绽开花朵，处于
生的和死的苦恼之间。这正是记忆的用处：
为了解脱——不是因为爱得不够
而是爱超乎欲望之外的扩展，于是不仅从过去
也从未来得到解脱。这样，对一个地方的爱恋
始于我们对自己的活动场所的依附
终于发现这种活动没多大意义
虽然决不是冷漠。历史也许是奴役，
历史也许是自由。瞧，那一张张脸一处处地方
随着那尽其是能爱过它们的自我
一起，现在它们都消失了，
而在另一种模式下更新，变化。

罪是不可避免的，但是
一切终将安然无恙，而且
时间万物也终将安然无恙。
如果我又一次想起这个地方，
又一次想起那些人，他们并非全都值得称道，
既非直系亲属也非性情和善之辈，
却是一些具有特殊才能的人，
他们都受了一种共同的思潮的感召，
而联合在把他们分裂为营垒的斗争中；
如果我在黄昏时分想起一位国王，
想起三个和更多的人被处决在绞刑架上
还有一些死后默默无闻的人
在其他地方，在这里和国外，
我也想起一个双目失明悄然死去的人，
为什么我们纪念这些死去的人
就该胜于纪念那些濒临死亡的人呢？
这不是重新去敲响往昔的钟声
也不是召唤一朵玫瑰的幽灵的咒语。
我们无法复活那些古老的派别
我们无法恢复那些古老的政策
或者跟上一面古老的皮鼓敲击的鼓点。
这些人，和反对他们的那些人
和那些他们反对的人
如今都接受了无声的命令
归入一个单一的团体。
不管我们重幸运的人们继承到什么

我们已经从失败的人们取得了
他们不得不留给我们的一切——一种象征：
一种在死亡中得到完善的象征。
因此，通过动机的纯化
凭着我们祈求的理由
一切终将安然无恙，而且
时间万物也终将安然无恙。

四

鸽子喷吐着炽烈的恐怖的火焰
划破夜空，掠飞而下
烈焰的火舌昭吿世间
它免除了死者的过错和罪愆。
那仅有的希望，要不就是失望
在于你对焚尸柴堆的选择或者就在于柴堆——
通过烈火从烈火中得到涤罪。

是谁想出这种折磨的呢？是爱。
爱是不熟悉的名字
它在编织火焰之衫的那双手后面，
火焰使人无法忍耐

那衣衫绝非人力所能解开。
我们只是活着，只是悲叹
不是让这种火就是让那种火把我们的生命耗完。

五

我们叫做开始的往往就是结束
而宣告结束也就是着手开始。
终点是我们出发的地方。每个短语
和每个句子只要安排妥帖（每个词都各得其所，
从它所处的位置支持其他的词，
文字既不羞怯也不炫耀，
新与旧之间的一种轻松的交流，
普通的文字确切而不鄙俗，
规范的文字准确而不迂腐，
融洽无间地在一起舞蹈）
那么每个短语每个句子都是一个结束和一个开始，
每首诗都是一篇墓志铭。而任何一个行动
都是走向断头台，走向烈火，落入大海
或走向一块你无法辨认的石碑的一步：
而这就是我们出发的地方，
我们与濒临死亡的人们偕亡：
瞧，他们离去了，我们与他们同行。
我们与死者同生：
瞧，他们回来了，携我们与他们俱来。
玫瑰飘香和紫杉扶疏的时令
经历的时间一样短长。一个没有历史的民族
不能从时间得到拯救，因为历史
是无始无终的瞬间的一种模式，所以，当一个冬天的下午
天色渐渐暗淡的时候，在一座僻静的教堂里
历史就是现在和英格兰。

由于这种爱和召唤声的吸引
我们将不停止探索
而我们一切探索的终点
将是到达我们出发的地方
并且是生平第一遭知道这地方。
当时间的终极犹待我们去发现的时候
穿过那未认识的，忆起的大门
就是过去曾经是我们的起点；
在最漫长的大河的源头
有深藏的瀑布的飞湍声
在苹果林中有孩子们的欢笑声，
这些你都不知道，因为你
并没有去寻找
而只是听到，隐约听到，
在大海两次潮汐之间的寂静里。
倏忽易逝的现在，这里，现在，永远——
一种极其简单的状态
（要求付出的代价却不比任何东西少）
而一切终将安然无恙，
时间万物也终将安然无恙
当火舌最后交织成牢固的火焰
烈火与玫瑰化为一体的时候。
