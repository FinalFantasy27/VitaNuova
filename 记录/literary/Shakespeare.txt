ghost见哈姆雷特在一段序之后说

Hold, Hold, my heart; And you, my sinews, frow not instant old, but bear me stiffly up!-Remember thee?......Remmeber thee?

O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo (Romeo and Juliet)

Good night, good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow
That I should say good night till it be morrow.
   —Romeo and Juliet, II.ii

“The time is out of joint”hamlet
“That ever I was born to set it right!"
