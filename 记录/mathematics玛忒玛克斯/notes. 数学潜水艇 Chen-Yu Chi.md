**Def** A topological space $X = (X, \mathscr{T}_x)$, consists of a set $X$ and a family of subsets $\mathscr{T}_x$ of $X$, 
s.t. (1) $X$ and $\emptyset \in \mathscr{T}_x$, 
(2) for any $U_\alpha \in \mathscr{T}_x, \underset{\alpha \in A}{\cup} U_\alpha \in \mathscr{T}_x$,
(3) for any $U, U'\in\mathscr{T}_x, U \cap U' \in \mathscr{T}_x$.
