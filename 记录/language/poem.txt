·Italian(Petrarca): abba abba cdcdcd or cdecde, the first 8 lines we call an octave, 4 lines a Quatrain, at the very begining of the 9th line, we have the turn, logical or emotional turn, and then the sestet, a two-part division of thought is invented

A standard Italian sonnet provides the subject in the first quatrain, and expands it sufficiently in the second, and then at the start of the sestet, projects the turn which will open up for solution to the problem in the quatrain
