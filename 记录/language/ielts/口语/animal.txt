we’d imagine anything other than elegant

I'd like to talk about the leopard, an animal has a small, light physique, and its rosettes are generally small, densely packed and without central spots. It can be found in many parts of Africa.
Just like the tiger and the lion, the leopard is also a member of the cat family, and ... in many ways leopard is just big cats. 
However, who would not be amazed by leopard's strength and beauty?
When hunting, it can run at speeds of up to 58 km/h (i.e. 16 m/s).
The Leopard is not social animal. It lives alone. It hunts alone and defends its hunting grounds alone.
I like leopards because they are fascinating creatures, to quote from Ridley Scott's 1978 film "Alien", "I admire its purity. A survivor … unclouded by conscience, remorse, or delusions of morality."
