The table illustrates four reasons why adults in the UK have attended arts events over the past twenty years. The major reason over the whole twenty-year period was a desire to see a specific performer or artist; while the least important reason was attending arts events for work-related reasons.

The percentage of people who attended events out of a desire to see a particular performer has remained relatively stable throughout the twenty-year period; varying from 58% twenty years ago to 56% today.

On the other hand, the percentage of people accompanying children has shown a significant increase, from 9% 20 years ago to just under a quarter today. As far as those who attended arts events because of special occasions or celebrations are concerned, the percentage fell slightly from 27% 20 years ago to 20% a decade ago, dropping dramatically to 9% today.

There has been a slight increase in the percentage of people attending arts events for work or business, from 6% 20 years ago to just over 10% today.

Overall, there has been a rise in people attending events in order to accompany children and for work-related reasons, while fewer people choose to attend an arts event as a form of celebration.
