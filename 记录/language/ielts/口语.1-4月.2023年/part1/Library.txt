Library

1 Do you often go to the library?

Rarely these days. I used to go in my first year at uni – mainly to study and do bits of research. This past two years I've not really been to the library – I rely on a lot of online resources for my studies now, and I have my own study room, so I work there.

2 What do you usually do in the library?

Well, I don't go to the library these days, but when I did, I usually just took out a couple of books and sat in a quiet corner and read them and made notes in preparation for essays.

3 Did you go to a library when you were a kid?

Not really, no. There were not really any libraries with kids books in my town when I grew up. So, I almost never went to the library. Apart from the school library, of course.

4 Do children in your country often go to a library?

Not very often these days. They go to book corners and libraries in their schools, but that's about it really. People buy kids books now, online or from bookshops. They don't really go to libraries.
