1 Do you like art?

Yes, I love art. I like many different types of art, actually. I love traditional Chinese paintings and calligraphy, but I also really enjoy looking at western art, art from different periods in history, as well as abstract art, sculpture and even performance art. I'm a big fan of all types of culture and so I enjoy visiting museums and art galleries when I go to another country or when I visit another city in China. Art is an important part of life and children who learn about art usually end up being thoughtful, creative and innovative people when they get older.

2 Have you ever visited an art gallery?
I've visited lots of art galleries, in my city, Beijing, as well as in other cities. I enjoy modern art galleries the most, but I also like to see painting and artwork from history as well. There are quite a few different art galleries in my city and I sometimes go to the temporary exhibitions at one gallery in particular that is in the famous art district, 798. I know the manager of that gallery too, so I enjoy going there, chatting to her and perhaps taking a coffee at one of the boutique arty coffee shops nearby.

The painter modeled his style after that of Picasso.

3 Do you want to be an artist?

No, I don't want to be an artist. I'm not good enough at art, to be honest, and I think you've got to be either excellent at art, or have deep connections in the art world to really succeed in the field. So, no, although I enjoy art, I see it more as an interest or hobby and not something as a life vocation.

4 Do you like modern art or traditional art?

Both. I appreciate all types of art. I don't have a specific type that I like, really. If something is beautiful, at least in my view, I can appreciate it, whether it is old-fashioned or traditional, or modern and abstract.
