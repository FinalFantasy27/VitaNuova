Schools

1 Where is your school

I've been to several schools in my life! The one I remember the most is by the Confucius temple in Beijing. That was a lovely little school. It's a famous area in the hutongs not far from the Lama temple.

2 Do you like your school

I liked this school at the time yes. I had quite a few friends and most of the teachers were pretty friendly and kind. I quite liked it.

3 Are you content with the learning atmosphere in your school

Again, I have to emphasise that I haven't been to school for many years – but the school I went to that I remember the most, the one by the Confucius temple in Beijing, I really did feel content with the learning atmosphere there.

4 Is there anything you want to change about your school

If I could go back in time and change anything, then I suppose I'd change the sports facilities and sports classes – I think these classes were regimental and old-fashioned and we had bad facilities. I'd definitely upgrade them. Maybe they've done so already for the pupils, since I left 20 years ago!
