Geography

1 Have you ever studied geography at school?

I did study geography, yes. Physical geography, like plate tectonics – volcanoes and things like that, as well as land formation, and farming and the water cycle, and all of that type of stuff. We also studied human geography as well – population, demographics and things like that.

2 Do you like geography?

I do, actually. I find it quite interesting – especially physical geography. I’m interested in things related to the natural environment and the planet. And I am concerned about climate change and environmental issues facing us today, so I find geography relevant as well as interesting.

3 Do you want to travel to a country because of its geographical conditions?

Yes, I think so. At least it is one of the reasons I would choose to travel to a country, yes. For example, I am interested in lakes – I would like to spend some time in Sweden at the lakes – I heard they have a lot of lakes and it’s common to spend holidays at the lakes, go in boats and things like that. So, yes, I would choose a country with lots of lakes and water.
