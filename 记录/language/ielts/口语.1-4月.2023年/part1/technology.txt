Technology

1 What technological products do you often use, computers or mobile phones?

I use both - computers, mobile phones, and I have a tablet. I use all of them for both work and social communications. Today, pretty much everyone needs a phone, at least, and most people who work in my field will have a tablet and a computer too.

2 What electronic devices have you bought lately?

I haven’t bought any electronic devices this year. Last year I bought a new tablet, because my old one was several years old and the memory was full, which meant it had slowed down to the point where it was no longer efficient to use. But since then, I’ve not bought anything else electronic.

3 Are there any technological devices you want to buy?

I’d like to buy a really good pair of noise cancelling headphones. I have a small pair of headphones that come with my mobile phone, but they don’t block out the noise of people and traffic when I’m commuting to work. So, I want to buy a nice quality pair of headphones that are great for sound, but block out the outside noises really effectively.

4 What benefits does technology bring to us?

Technology brings us a host of benefits. It would take too long to list them all! But, in short, the main things technology offers to society is fast, effective communication which enables us to streamline business and personal interactions and communications and get things done quickly.
