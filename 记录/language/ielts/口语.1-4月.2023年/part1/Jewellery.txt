1 How often do you wear jewellery?

I'm not a big fan of jewellery to be honest. I wear earrings pretty much every day but they are quite simple earrings. They're not a very ostentatious or prominent style. They're quite simple but tasteful, and good quality. I sometimes wear a thin silver necklace, a simple chain, with a little heart shaped stone on the end. That's about it really.

2 What type of jewellery do you like best?

I like earrings, a nice watch, and a simple silver chain necklace, mainly. If I go to a fancy party or a company dinner then I wear something that stands out more and that's more eye-catching.

3 Have you ever given jewellery to someone as a gift?

I have on several occasions, to my friends. I went on holiday to the USA a few years ago and bought some nice items of jewellery for my friends from a factory outlet. I think that was the last time I gave jewllery to someone as a gift.

4 Why do you think some people wear a piece of jewellery for a long time?

I think that a good piece of jewellery can be worn for many years, and even passed down through the generations – ideally, anyway. So, yes, I believe that some jewellery can at least be kept for many decades, and worn from time to time on special occasions. Some people wear the same piece of jewellery all the time, I guess – like a fancy watch or a ring.
