Sports

1.Do you like watching sports programs on TV?

I don't really. I am not much of a sporty person. I follow some of the Olympic events, but apart from that I have very little interest in televised sports, to be honest.

2.Do you watch live sports games?

Actually, you know, I've never been to a live sports game in my life. Well.. apart from those on sports days in school, and sometimes watching my friends play basketball on campus.

3.Who do you like to watch sports games with?

When I watch sports, I enjoy watching them with a couple of my classmates. They're fun people to watch games with. I find it's a lot more exciting watching sports with other people, especially people are really enthusiastic about the sport. The excitement can be contagious.

4.What kinds of games do you expect to watch in the future?

I really don't know to be honestâ€¦.perhaps football. I enjoy football, because I followed a lot of English teams when I lived in the UK, and I also enjoy watching football, so I think I will continue to follow a lot of the major football games. Especially the World Cup.
