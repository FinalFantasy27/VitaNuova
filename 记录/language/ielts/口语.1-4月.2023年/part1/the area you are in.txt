The area you live in

1.Where do you like to go in that area?

Well, a lot of changes are taking place nowadays in my city. I can see more and more skyscrapers having been built and the public transportation system is becoming more diversified and completed. But for me, the most fantastic change is that there is greater diversity in restaurants! Now I can taste genuine foreign food in my city. How marvelous it is!
