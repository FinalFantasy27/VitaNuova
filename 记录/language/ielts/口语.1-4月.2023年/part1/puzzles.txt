Puzzles

1 Did you like doing puzzles when you were a kid?

Yes, when I was a kid there were lots of puzzles we could do – with string, and wood, and jigsaws and all sorts of little stuff like that. Now, there isn’t so much – there’s a lot of puzzle games, and games involving cryptic thinking on apps on phones and tablets, though. Those are popular today.

2 When do you do puzzles, during trips or when you feel bored?

I usually play such puzzle games on my phone when I’m on the train or on a bus, or something like that. I also fiddle with my phone in bed too, like a lot of people, and yes, sometimes I play games which you could call ‘puzzles’ I guess.

3 Do you like doing word puzzles or number puzzles?

I prefer number puzzles – I am really good at math, and I like solving little math problems. There are plenty of games which involving solving number puzzles and I enjoy doing these. I get a great sense of satisfaction from getting the answers right.

4 Do you think it is good for old people to do puzzles?

Yes, most certainly. I think old people should do these things to keep their minds active – a lot of research shows that older people remain mentally sharp for longer if they keep engaging their brains in puzzles and activities that involving thinking and solving things.
