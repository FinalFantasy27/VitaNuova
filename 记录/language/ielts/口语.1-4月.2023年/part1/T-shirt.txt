I'm a huge fan of T-shirts!
I believe that comfort is key, so I prefer T-shirts made from soft, lightweight cotton with a relaxed fit.
They are just so easy to wear and pair with other pieces, making them a staple in my wardrobe.

1 Do you usually wear T-shirts?

I wear T-shirts very often, in fact. Especially in summer when the weather is warm. I enjoy the freedom of wearing a t-shirt and I have quite a few different ones with all sorts of designs on them in fact – from sporty-style T-shirts with the classic sports logos, to more amusing T-shirts with funky designs and patterns on them.

2 Do you like T-shirts with pictures or prints?

Absolutely yes. I love all sorts of different T-shirts, and I also enjoy buying them as souvenirs when I go on holiday or visit other countries. There are also quite a few designer T-shirts out now which are pretty interesting in terms of modern unique designs.

3 Do you think older people are fashionable if they wear T-shirts?

Well… I'm not sure but yes, I guess so. Although most older people don't seem to wear T-shirts as much as younger people, I'd say that they might look fashionable in certain t-shirts, yes, maybe. In a way it's a strange question because I think that looking fashionable also really depends on what suits a person and how they carry it off, regardless of age.

4 Have you ever bought T-shirts as souvenirs?

Yes, I certainly have. I always buy a T-shirt for a souvenir, usually for myself, when I am on holiday somewhere interesting. For example, I went to Thailand a few months ago, and in the central market areas of Bangkok there are lots of tourist stalls in the markets which sell interesting, entertaining and artistic t-shirts. I bought a few there.
