Keys

1 Do you always bring a lot of keys with you

Not these days, no. Today so much is electronic, whether it's the office door or the door of my home â€“ codes and finger prints and stuff like that. We hardly use physical metal keys for anything these days.

2 Have you ever lost your keys

Yes, I once lost the keys for a locker at work, and it had a laptop in it. It was a real pain getting a new set from the building management office. I had to fill in lots of forms and complete all sorts of ID procedures and get signatures from my line manager. It was a pain.

3 How can we avoid losing keys

Many people avoid losing keys by keeping them on a key ring on their belt. However, that's not so easy for girls or people who don't wear traditional trousers with belt loops. So, I guess it's a case of keeping your keys in a safe place or a pocket or purse you can zip up.
