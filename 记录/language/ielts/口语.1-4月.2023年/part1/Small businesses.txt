Small businesses

1 Are there any famous small businesses in the area you live in

Oh, let me think… There are a couple, yes. The two that spring to mind are two little restaurants, actually. They are famous in my area – one is a roast lamb leg eatery, which is a family place that's been there for generations. The other is a dumpling place – again, a family business that's stood the test of time!

2 Do you prefer buying things from small or big companies

In an ideal world I'd purchase things from small businesses to support families and the local economy. But, big companies usually have better prices and a wider range of products.

3 Have you ever worked in small businesses

I have worked in a few small businesses actually. I did a lot of summer work in a family-run restaurant in my home town, for example, and I also have done two internships at graphic design companies.

4 Have you ever thought about starting your own business

I most certainly have – and I still want to – in fact, a friend and I were discussing this the other day. About getting together and starting an online platform to sell designer sportswear sourced from Vietnam. So, yes, very recently I've been thinking about this.
