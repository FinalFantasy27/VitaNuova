Describe a place you visited where the air was polluted.

You should say:

Where the place is

When you visited there

Why the air was polluted

And explain how you felt about the place

Sadly, I’ve visited many places where the air was polluted. But the one that really sticks in my mind is a city in the north east when I went to visit an uncle of mine. It’s an industrial city and is famous for car factories and a steel plant. This means that the main source of industry in the city is quite a polluting industry really. Also, because of the climatic conditions – it’s a cold place and surrounded by hills that trap the air inside the city basin – the air doesn’t move out of the city much and there are no real winds to blow it. So, when the pollution gets bad, and the cloud cover is extensive, then the bad air just sits there over the city and doesn’t really move. It’s horrible, actually. So, it’s a combination of the industry in the city and the geography and climate of the area. I feel depressed when I’m in a place with bad air, to be honest. It’s not only unhealthy to breathe, but it’s just depressing to see and experience. It’s so unnatural, and it can even smell bad too. I last visited this place, as I was saying earlier, to visit my uncle, and it was perhaps at the start of winter, which made it even worse because that is when the coal-fired power stations are all turned on to provide heat to the houses and buildings for the cold winter months. In terms of air conditions, this is the worst time of year to visit because you get the power plant fumes and the factory fumes and traffic fumes all accumulating at the same time. I really hope they can improve this situation in the future.
