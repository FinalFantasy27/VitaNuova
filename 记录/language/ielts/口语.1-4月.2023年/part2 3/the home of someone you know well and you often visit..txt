Describe the home of someone you know well and you often visit.

You should say:

Whose home it is

How often you go there

What it is like

And explain how you feel about the home

There is a home that really sticks in mind! It’s the home of my friend, James, and his family, who live just in the community next to ours. The reason I find it particularly interesting is because it’s in a much older community – and those old residential buildings are, in my opinion, much better, because the rooms are really big, and the ceilings are high, and they all have balconies. The modern residential buildings may look cooler, but they are often small, they don’t have balconies and the ceilings are much lower. I visit there often because the family are really welcoming and kind and relaxed. And, also, there’s plenty of space, so often we just hang out in the living room – well, one of them – they have two, in fact. I go there about 4 times a week, actually, and even more in the holidays. James’ mother cooks really well… in fact, so does his father. They seem to enjoy it, and prepare meals quickly, that are really tasty. Often, I will stay there the whole day and we play on the Playstation, read books, play football in the community gardens. Stuff like that. The house is decorated in a very curious way – the father has travelled all over the world and filled the house with interesting paintings, and decorations from mainly African countries, and some South American countries. So, yeah, it sticks in mind as I spend a lot of time there.
