Describe a person who is fashionable

You should say:

Who he/she is

What he/she does

What kind of clothes he/she wears

And explain why you think this person is fashionable

A person I know who is really fashionable is my friend, James. Actually, I’d say he was a fashion victim. Although he’s a good friend of mine, I must say that we don’t always see eye to eye about everything. And the one thing that I don’t really like that much about him is his obsession with following the latest trends and fashion brands. He’s a student, actually. He studies physics in my university. He mainly wears sporty clothes – and recently there are loads of new styles in the ‘sports genre’ that keep coming out. He seems to always be buying new sneakers, new tops, new hoodies, new plastic-rubber slip-on sporty sandals… you name it! He also buys bags, bracelets or wrist bands, water bottles and all the kinds of accessories they sell in these stores or online. It’s as if he’s a huge victim of their advertising campaigns. I mean, it does make him one of the most fashionable people I know – there’s no doubt about that – but, personally I think it’s quite over the top and I don’t see the attraction at all. I’ve never really worried too much about following fashions; I like to wear what I think looks nice and is comfortable, and I think I have good eye for coordinating clothes, but when it comes to following fashion trends or buying the latest stuff, I’m not that bothered. Anyway, my friend is a cool guy and a nice kind person.. so, hey, I guess we all have different interests.
