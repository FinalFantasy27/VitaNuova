1. Is it important for children to have a right attitude towards money?
Yes, it is very important for children to have the right attitude towards money. Children should learn the importance of money and saving it/not wasting it starting at an early age, so that this habit continues in the future when they start working and earning.

2. What do you think of the saying; love of money is the root of all evil?

Occasions like birthdays, weddings, congratulating someone on the birth of a baby, and some other such occasions require people to send money as gifts, especially in the Indian culture.

5. In your country, do parents give children money for doing housework?
In my country, India, it is not very common for parents to give money to their children for housework. There maybe very few parents who do this and it is mostly considered as the children’s responsibility to help with the housework. In terms of money, children get pocket money for their daily/weekly/monthly expenses.
