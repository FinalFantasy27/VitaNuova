audience rating 收视率
1. This love song makes me understand that time will heal everything. No matter how badly you are hurt, things will get better eventually.
2. This movie makes me reconsider the true meaning of love. Love is give and take. If you want something in a relationship, you need to give something back equally.
3. After watching this TV show, I’ve got a better understanding about foreign culture. I’ve also learned how to have daily communication with foreigners in different situations.
4. This advertisement has largely raised people’s awareness of protecting the environment. Everybody has to do his part to make our world a better place.
