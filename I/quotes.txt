“我要在这里漫无顺序地写下我的思想，但也许并非是一种毫无计划的混乱不堪：这才是真正的顺序所在，它将永远以无顺序的本身表明我的对象。”【帕斯卡尔，《思想录》，何兆武译，中国国际广播出版社2009，第165页】

almost-quote Pascal, “I made this talk longer than usual because I lacked
the time to make it shorter”

There'll be plenty of time to rest in the grave.
 Quoted in D MacHale, Comic Sections (Dublin 1993)

大江歌罢掉头东，邃密群科济世穷。
面壁十年图破壁，难酬蹈海亦英雄

庾信平生最萧瑟，暮年诗赋动江关
