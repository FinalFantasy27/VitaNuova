Lin Dan
Possibly the greatest badminton player of all time 
christened “Super Dan” way back in 2004
completed the impossible sounding ’Super Grand Slam’ by the age of 28: winning all of the nine major badminton tournaments available – including the Olympic Games, World Championships, World Cup and other ‘majors’ of the sport. He remains the only player, male or female, to achieve the feat.
In his home nation for Beijing 2008,  he got through to a final against his big rival Lee Chong Wei, from Malaysia. The home crowd went wild to salute one of their heroes of the Games.
