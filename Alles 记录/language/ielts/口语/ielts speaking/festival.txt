The most important festival in China is by far the Spring Festival, which is also known as the Chinese New Year. This is when we're reunited with our family members, eat a big meal together, which usually features dumplings or sticky rice cakes. Another big part of the celebration is watching the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. There's singing, dancing, magic and various other kinds of performance for us to watch while we stay up to ring in the new year. Although this gala is not as popular as before and it gets mocked every year now, most people still tune in when they're having their reunion dinner. Well, actually, China is a massive country and traditions vary from region to region and from province to province, but the Spring Festival is, without doubt, the most important and the concept of family and reunion is at the center of it

prosperous New Year
