Chopsticks (Chinese: 筷子 or 箸; Pinyin: kuaizi or zhu) are shaped pairs of equal-length sticks of Chinese origin that have been used as kitchen and eating utensils in most of East and Southeast Asia for over three millennia. They are held in the dominant hand, secured by fingers, and wielded as extensions of the hand, to pick up food.
They are traditionally made of wood, bamboo and metal, and in modern days, increasingly available in non-traditional materials such as plastic and stainless steel.
First used by the Chinese, chopsticks later spread to other parts of Asia.
