Describe a noisy place you have been to

You should say:

What it is

When you went there

What you did there

And explain why you feel it is a noisy place

An especially noisy place that I visited recently was a railway station. It’s basically the biggest railway station in my city. Because recently, there has been a major holiday starting in my country, the station has been especially busy. It’s usually pretty busy anyway, but at this time of year it’s busier than usual. So, I went to this station, not to travel, in fact, but to collect a bunch of tickets for some people in my company. You still, on occasions, have to collect physical tickets at railway stations in my city. Anyway, I went on the subway and made the terrible mistake of going during one of the peak travel times, to collect these tickets. Really, to be honest, I should have waited till the late evening, but anyway, I went around rush hour, right after my day at the office had come to an end. It was just unbelievable – I have never ever seen the place so crowded. There were literally thousands of people, from all walks of life, with bags, backpacks, luggage, all sorts. On top of that, in my country there are lots of security checks to get in and out of railways stations, so this causes even more crowds and bottlenecks at certain points in the process. People were all talking at the same time, guards were shouting, car horns were beeping outside, there was a loud speaker, well, many loudspeakers, announcing train times and all sorts of other instructions and notices. It was horrible. I’m pretty sensitive to noise. I rarely travel, and I don’t even go to busy restaurants or things like this, so for me it was unbearable. It took ages to get through the thick crowds to the ticket offices too. Anyway, so that was the last time I was in a really busy place. And I hated it, and do not want to repeat the experience.
