You should say:

What it was

When you heard it

How you knew it

And explain how you felt about it

Some good news I heard about last week, about a person I know well, is that my sister recovered really quickly from an illness she had, just in time to do her ballet exam. She has been taking ballet really seriously since she was a child, and every six months she takes an exam, which enables her to get to the next level, and then enter into a new session at her ballet school. She came down with a terrible flu just a few weeks ago, which meant she missed quite a few practice sessions, and also she just felt awful and pretty much had to stay in bed. She was very worried, on top of being sick, that she would miss her ballet exam, which would set her back quite a bit – you see the external examiners only come around the country every six months on a fairly tight schedule. Anyway, fortunately, she seemed to recover really quickly and actually not only made the exam, but performed really well in it. Much to her own surprise! Maybe the rest did her good after all! You see, she is actually almost a professional dancer – well, she wants to be – and will attend a performing arts school in London next year if she gets the right results in various tests and exams, so this is a very important thing in her life. She’s not a very academic person, so she isn’t great at the usual studies most of us have to do, but she’s got an innate talent for dance, and my parents have really encouraged and supported that. I knew about her illness and everything else because I talk to my parents and her on text and phone fairly often. Also, she was sick in bed for two weeks so she was bored and messaged me a lot!

1 Is it good to share something on social media?

2 Should the media only publish good news?
