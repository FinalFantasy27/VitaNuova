My favourite TV show is a popular reality show called America's Funniest Home videos.
The show is like... people send in their funny homemade videos. Then the host plays the  videos ona large screen and makes comments on the videos.
Many of the videos show funny moments at wedding or parties. Also, some people send in videos showing the mistakes made by their young childern. Like using judices as shampoo. 
I enjoy watching this show because the host has a great sense of humor. He keeps the viewers laughing throught the show. I enjoy watching the show also because it's allabout family life and ordinary people. I guess that's why it attracts so many viewers.
