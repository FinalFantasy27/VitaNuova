Outer space and stars

1 Have you ever learnt about outer space and stars?

Yes, in school we learnt the basic things about space and the solar system. Also, I've seen a number of documentaries about the universe on television. I find the topic quite inspiring.

2 Are you interested in films about outer space and stars?

Yes, I'd say so, yes. I enjoy sci-fi films, although I don't think there are many really good ones. I also have seen a few TV series set in space which I've enjoyed.

3 Do you want to go into outer space in the future?

Haha, no I don't think so. I've heard that some millionaires have actually signed up to go into the lower regions of space in space crafts, or orbit the earth, but I don't really have much of a fascination with this. To be honest, I think I'd be scared! I don't like heights!
