Chocolate

1 Do you like eating chocolate? Why/Why not?

I love it! I absolutely love eating chocolate, although I know it's not really good for the teeth or the physical health really… I don't care – I enjoy it. And I don't have many vices, so I don't feel too guilty about it. Cakes and chocolates – I love them!

2 Did you often eat chocolate when you were a child?

I didn't often eat chocolate. In fact, where I grew up, which was a fairly small town outside Taiyuan, there wasn't really any chocolate available. Mainly because it just wasn't in demand. People ate other kinds of sweets and confectionary, not really chocolate. I do enjoy chocolate now, though, I've developed the habit since moving to the city, and also it has become marketed more in my country and more popular all-round since I was young.

3 What's your favorite flavour?

I like milk chocolate and white chocolate. I don't really like chocolate that has nuts or fruit in it. Except a certain type of chocolate that has a strawberry cream filling – I love that!

4 Do you think it is good to give others chocolate as gifts?

Yes, chocolates are a nice gift, and you can buy lovely boxes of chocolates presented really well with a variety of different flavours of chocolates in them. Those make great gifts.

5 Why do you think chocolate is popular around the world?

I think chocolate is popular for two main reasons. Firstly, because it is universally a taste that people like – it's neither very strong or very sweet, or very distinct in flavor in a way that would turn people off. But it's also nice, easy to eat and not that expensive (depending on the type you buy). Secondly, it's marketing. Big companies realized they could make money by advertising and marketing chocolate all over the world, and they did so, and it seemed to work!
