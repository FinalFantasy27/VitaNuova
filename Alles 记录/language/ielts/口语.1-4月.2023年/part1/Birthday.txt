Birthday

1 What do you usually do on your birthday?

On my birthday I usually have a dinner with my parents, usually at a nice restaurant in the city. Then I might go out for drinks with my friends, or to the cinema or something like that. That’s been the habit, anyway, for the past few years.

2 What did you do on your birthday when you were young?

When I was younger… a child… we would just have a dinner at home, and I would receive some presents. And in school the class would sing a birthday song and I’d have a cake. That’s about it really. I found my birthday quite exciting as a child, as most kids do, I think.

3 Do you think it is important for you to celebrate your birthday?

I think it’s fairly important. It’s a milestone… a turning point in the year, and in life, and it is symbolic of the years passing, us getting older and more mature, so yeah, I think it’s important.
