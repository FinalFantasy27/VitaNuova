Music

1 Do you like music?

Yeah of course I do, I'm a huge music fan, in fact I think I can say I've loved music all my life, ever since I was a kid, for as long as I can remember. Music is an important part of my life and I listen to it every day, even when I'm at work, I've always got my headphones on.

2 What kinds of music do you like to listen to?

I'm not sure that I have one specific 'favourite type' of music to be honest, I'm quite into a variety of styles and genres, but generally speaking I think I tend to prefer songs without lyrics or vocals, you know like instrumental music, I listen to quite a lot of classical, film tracks, ambient or even electronic music… As long as it's relaxing, atmospheric music, it doesn't really matter what genre it is.

3 Do you enjoy the same kind of music as your friends?

Pretty much, yes, I listen to a lot of the same music as my friends – at least some of them. There are a few friends I have that have quite eclectic music tastes, like myself. We tend to recommend bands and tunes to each other, share them and discuss them.

4 Which singer or musician would you like to see in concert?

I'd love to see Ed Sheeran in concert, live. I hope he can come to my country to do a concert. Although I like a variety of different genres of music, his kind of pop music I find is really dynamic and inspiring when you see him live on stage performing.
