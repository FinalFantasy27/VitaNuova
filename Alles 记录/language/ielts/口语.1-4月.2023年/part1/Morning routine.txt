Morning Routine

1 Do you like to get up early in the mornings?

Not really. I’m not a morning person… but I’m not a night person either. I guess you could say I’m an afternoon person? Or more precisely, a person who “loves to sleep” kind of person!? Either way, it’s a daily struggle to peel myself out of bed, so I need all the help I can get.

2 What is your morning routine?

I wake up around 6:00am when my alarm goes off, and snooze for a few minutes. When I finally roll out of bed, I take a shower, quickly put on my makeup, blend my daily smoothies, then I am out of the door. If it’s a non-working day, I’ll hit the gym, or I’ll just chat with my boyfriend for a bit, before taking a shower.

3 Which one is your favorite morning in the whole week?

My favourite morning is Saturday morning because I don’t have to get up for work and I can lie in bed for hours reading or watching TV series. Saturday morning is most certainly my favourite morning and it always has been.

4 Do you want to change your daily routines in the future?

If there’s one thing I could change it would be having a lie-in in the morning. I always wake up really early and get out of bed as soon as I wake up which means I never really have a lie-in. Sometimes I get a bit tired in the afternoon and I think it’s because I get up too early. So yeah I’d like to be able to have a lie-in sometimes.
