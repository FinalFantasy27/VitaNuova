1 Do you like singing?

I love singing. I thoroughly enjoy going to KTVs and singing on my own at home to music, too.

2 Have you ever learnt how to sing?

No, not really. To be honest, I’m not very good at singing – I think I might be tone deaf, even. In school plays and performances I was never chosen to be one of the leading singers, and in KTV with friends, I usually try to keep a low profile and mouth the words – I really can’t sing well.3 If

you sing, who would you sing in front of?

I wouldn’t want to sing for anyone – I’d be way too embarrassed and self-conscious. As I said, I’m a terrible singer! I would find it uncomfortable, so no, I would not sing for, or in front of anyone, if I could avoid it.

4 Do you think singing can bring happiness to people?

I understand that singing, if you’re good enough at it, can make people feel very happy. The person singing as well as those listening. Singing is a great form of musical expression, and there’s nothing more lovely than the human voice. So, yes, it can bring happiness for sure.
