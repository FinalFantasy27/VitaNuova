Names

1 Does your name have a special meaning?

Not really. I am named after my grandfather who was from Gansu, and apparently I have a name that goes back many generations in my family. I also share a character of my Grandmother's name as well. Apart from that, no there is no special meaning to my name.

2 How do people choose names for their children?

Some people seek the advice of a fortune teller or a wise person! Most people discuss it with their family and think about it for quite a long time, and choose something that means something to them, sounds lucky or is simply nice-sounding.

3 Does anyone in your family have the same name with you?

Yes, several people have the same two characters in their name as mine. I have three characters in my name. One of them is specific to me. The others are related to my grandparents and parents. I think this is pretty much the same for many people I know.

4 Are there any differences between how Chinese name their children now and in the past?

I am not sure to be honest. I think people are a bit less traditional in their choices of names than before, and young people try to think of more original and special character combinations. But, pretty much, in general, I don't think there have been big changes in naming customs and habits.
