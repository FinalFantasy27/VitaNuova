Writing

1 Do you write a lot?

I don't write much at all, actually. Now that I've graduated I no longer have to write endless essays and assignments, like I've been used to for the past three or four years. So, I don't write much – I write job application letters, and emails, but I don't have to write a lot at the moment.

2 What do you like to write?

I don't really like to write much these days. I write emails to my family, and text messages to friends, and that's about it at the moment. Like I said, I'm enjoying having a break from years of having to write assignments.

3 Do you prefer typing or handwriting when you are writing something?

Most definitely typing, I think - to be honest, my handwriting now is awful – I'm just not used to writing by hand anymore.
