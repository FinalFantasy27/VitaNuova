1 What snacks did you eat when you were young?

When I was a kid I used to love all kinds of street snacks – there were lots of little stalls selling pancakes and all sorts in my road. When I was a little older, fast food joints started to open and become popular, and I loved those, and thought they were a real novelty. There we ate burgers and fried chicken and things like that.

2 Do you often eat snacks now?

I still eat local snacks actually, and there is quite a strong street-snack culture still existing in China, and occasionally I go to fast food outlets with friends – which are more expensive, but more comfortable and convenient.

3 Do you think eating snacks is healthy?

Certain snacks are healthy, yes, indeed. Fried street snacks and fast food are not so healthy though; at least if you eat them often. One has to be careful what one chooses in the way of snacking – a lot of sweets, chocolates, fries and burgers and deep-fried food is definitely not healthy. Everything in moderation, as they say!
