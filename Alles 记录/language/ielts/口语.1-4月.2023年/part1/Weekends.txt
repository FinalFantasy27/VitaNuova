1 What do you plan to do for next weekend?

Next weekend I have no real plans to be honest. I think I will relax at home, try to motivate myself to study a little bit, maybe watch a TV series I'm enjoying at the moment (a detective thriller) and go out for dinner with my family. I'll try to rest too – I've had a busy week.

2 Do you make plans for weekends?

It really depends. Sometimes yes, sometimes no. It totally depends on my workload and whether I have made any arrangements to meet friends, or go out and see a movie or something like that. Sometimes my friends and I plan a basketball game, but recently we've been a bit lazy about that.

3 What did you do last weekend?

Last weekend I celebrated the birthday of a good friend of mine, with a group of old classmates and some of our new friends. We went to a hot pot restaurant, and then we went to a bowling alley – you know, ten pin bowling – that was fun.

4 What do you usually do on weekends?

On weekends I do a variety of things. I rest, I read, I go out with friends to a park or go to the cinema. Occasionally I go have dinner in a restaurant – there are lots of new restaurants opening up in my city so I often go with a group of friends to a restaurant, usually a hotpot restaurant. I like eating out with friends and family – it's a popular communal activity in my country, actually.

5 Would you say weekends are important to us?

I think they're very important. It's when we get time to spend with family and friends and kick back and relax and forget about work or the hassles of daily life. Weekends are when we can wind down, recharge our batteries and relax a bit after a working week. I think everyone should have free weekends.
