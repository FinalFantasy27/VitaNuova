Social media

1 Do you like social media?

Yes, I most certainly see and enjoy the benefits of social media. Although I can also see the downsides of it too – there's a lot of gossip, misinformation and nonsense on social media, as well as informative discussion and communication. So, like most things, it's a double-edged sword. But I like it yes – it's predominantly great for communicating with work, friends and family.

2 Do you think your friends spend too much time on social media?

YES! Some are really obsessed with social media – constantly posting on their weibo pictures of their dinner, or parties, or days out. It's a bit excessive to be honest. I think a lot of my friends are a bit over the top about it. I am not so passionate about such things, personally. I use it mainly for practical communication.

3 Do you want to work in a social media company?

No, I don't. Today there are too many rules and regulations governing social media and it's a minefield. I'd prefer to work in a more relaxing field that is not so connected to public information sharing, gossip and stuff like this. I am not a very public-facing kind of person really!
