口头：
you've got A and B backwards here. (或者把here换成你想指的地方)

写给英国人的书信邮件可以说：Dear honorable XX,

It is with utmost deference and humility that I should suggest a putative corrigendum on your otherwise flawless recent publication. If you may be so kind as to permit my discourteous imputations, I should like to suggest item A and item B in paragraph 13 be transposed.Ceteris paribus, your publication remains the pinnacle of meticulous opus, one that is worthy of much praise and imitation. It is hence entirely plausible that my suggestion reads preposterous to you, a much possible outcome of my perennial dubiety.

Eagerly, I await your further illumination on this matter.

Yours truly,YY
