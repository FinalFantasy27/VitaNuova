Dugundji's theorem
In [modal logic], Dugundji's theorem proves that no modal logic that is a subsystem of S5 can have a finite, truth-value-like semantics.

Assume that we interpret the formulas ϕ of a modal logic as elements of a set M, traditionally called a matrix. This requires that we interpret all logical connectives of the logic (e.g. ∧, ∨, □, ...) as operations on this matrix M. Assume further that a subset T⊆M is used to represent the values that are "true". For example, we could interpret propositional logic by taking M to be {0,1}, and T to be {1}.

Then, Dugundji's theorem proves that no finite-value matrix can characterise any logic that is a subset of S5

The method used to arrive at such negative result is not original. As pointed out by Dugundji himself, his result was inspired by a previous proof by K. Gödel (Gödel, 1932) on a similar theorem concerning intuitionistic propositional logic IPC: Gödel proved that a wide family of logics encompassing IPC could not be characterized by finite logical matrices.

Starting with Gödel, passing through Dugundji's Theorem until arriving to paraconsistent logics, it will be shown that the results in (Arruda,1975) and (Carnielli, Coniglio e Marcos, 2007) support the thesis that, indeed, a comparatively small number of logic systems can be characterized by finite matrices (although there is an infinite number of many-valued logics). The first part of the present tutorial intends to trace a continuous line between the seven decades distancing these results.

Behind that line there exists, on the one hand, the attempt to generalize the semantics of finite matrices. By means of the notion of Nmatrices, it is possible to (non-deterministically) associate to each formula of a given language a set of possible truth-values, instead of a (deterministic) single truth-value. As proved in (Avron, 2005), Dugundji-like theorems even for Nmatrices persist for some systems of paraconsistent logics. In more precise terms: there is a vast family of paraconsistent systems such that no one of them can be semantically characterized by a single finite Nmatrix.

On the other hand, there have been attempts to generalize Dugundji's result in order to encompass the enormous amount of modal systems that have arisen since the publication of his theorem. Among them, it should be mentioned the results obtained by (Scroggs, 1951), (Esakia and Meskhi, 1970), (Chagrov and Zakharyaschiev, 1997) and (Coniglio and Peron, 2014).
