Derivations in natural deduction normalize, i.e., there is always a sequence of
reduction steps which transforms a derivation into a derivation in normal form. A
derivation is in normal form if no introduction rule for a connective is immediately
followed by an elimination rule for the same connective. This result plays a similar
role for natural deduction as the cut-elimination theorem plays for the sequent
calculus. In particular, it establishes the subformula property for natural deduction
derivations. As noted above, the subformula property is essential for the practical
implementation of proof search algorithms, since it limits the search space and
so eliminates one source of infeasibility in actually carrying out the search for a
derivation.
