"homogeneous", I guess you mean that for any a,b∈M
, there is an automorphism σ∈Aut(M)
 with σ(a)=b
. It might be helpful to clarify this, since "homogeneous structure" has a few different meanings - e.g., M
 is homogeneous if every isomorphism between finitely generated structures extends to an automorphism of M
