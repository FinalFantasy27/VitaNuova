<p>Let <em>M</em> be a structure in a language <em>L</em>. Let <em>L(M)</em> denote a new language, in which we have added a new constant symbol <em>a</em> for each element <em>a</em> of <em>M</em>. Then <em>M</em> can be expanded to an <em>L(M)</em>-structure in a tautological way.</p>
<p>The <strong>diagram</strong> of <em>M</em>, denoted diag(<em>M</em>) is the collection of all quantifier-free <em>L(M)</em>-statements true in <em>M</em>. The <strong>elementary diagram</strong> of <em>M</em>, denoted eldiag(<em>M</em>) is the collection of all <em>L(M)</em>-statements true in <em>M</em>.</p>
<p>The significance of these notions are that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Models of the diagram of <em>M</em> are the same thing as <em>L</em>-structures extending <em>M</em>.</li>
<li>Models of the elementary diagram of <em>M</em> are the same thing as <a href="/wiki/Elementary_extension" title="Elementary extension">elementary extensions</a> of <em>M</em>. ::: ::: :::</li>
</ul>
