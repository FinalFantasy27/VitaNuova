<strong>Welcome to Model Theory Wiki,</strong><br />
the research encyclopedia of mathematical logic and universal algebra that <a href="https://community.fandom.com/wiki/Help:Editing" title="Help:Editing">anyone can edit</a>.</p>
<p>This wiki will supplement <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Main Page">Wikipedia</a>'s coverage of the subject. It is expected that Wikipedia policies will be applied here, with some important modifications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:N" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WP:N">Notability</a> is evaluated with respect to the model theory community.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:V" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WP:V">Verifiability</a> criteria will be relaxed as appropriate for the community. Proofs and references to preprints by model theorists are sufficient. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:OR" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WP:OR">Original research</a> is welcome here.</li>
<li>It is likely that this online community will be more friendly than the Wikipedia community, since many editors will know each other personally. Very likely most users will contribute under their real name.</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:IAR" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:WP:IAR">Anything goes</a>, as long as it is focused on advancing serious mathematical research or its presentation.</li>
</ul>
