According to Poizat's book on stable groups, a stable theory is said to be '''unidimensional''' if any two non-algebraic types are non-orthogonal. It is a theorem, apparently due to Hrushovski and using stable groups, that any unidimensional theory is in fact superstable.

Unidimensional theories include things like strongly minimal theories, uncountably categorical (countable) theories, and theories <math>T</math> which are <math>\kappa</math>-categorical for large <math>\kappa</math> (maybe <math>\kappa > |T|</math>?).
