· in BDD, one of two inner nodes perfome the same role (the subBDDs below them have the same structure) could be removed

·BDD representing f·g can be obtained by taking the BDD f and replacing all its 1-terminals by B_g

·The reduced OBDD ("O" for "ordered") representing a given function f is unique. (let B and B' be two OBDDs with compatible variable orderings (there are no variables x and y such that x comes before y in the ordering of B and y comes before x in the ordering of B') representing the same boolean function, then they have identical structure.) (we can have two distinct BDDs which represent the same function)

· in general the size of the OBDD depens on the chosen variable ordering. (the OBDD representing the parity functions (a Boolean function whose value is one if and only if the input vector has an odd number of ones) is independent of the chosen variable ordering)

· shannon expansion: f \equiv f[0/x] + x \cdot f[1/x]

This observation can already be found in G.Boole's "The Laws of Thought"  from 1854.

·\exists x. f is defined as f[0/x] + f[1/x]

·The time complexity of the algorithm inputs OBDD B_f (reduced) and outputs B_{\exists x_1. \exists x_2 \cdots \exists x_n. f} (reduced) is Np-complete (3SAT can be reduced to nested existential boolean quantification)
