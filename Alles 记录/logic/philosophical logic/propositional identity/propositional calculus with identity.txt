Propositional calculi become more complex when we admit non-extensional operators. One of the intuitive steps is to introduce an identity operator which expresses something like ‘expresses the same proposition’ or ‘states the same fact’. If the criteria of identity are more fine-grained than in Frege’s account (according to which the denotation of any two sentences having the same truth value is the same), we get non-extensional calculi. Zero-order calculi with additional axioms and rules for identity, called Sentential Calculi with Identity (SCI), have been extensively studied by Suszko (1966, 1967, 1971f,e,d,b,a,c, 1972b,a, 1973, 1975, 1977) and developed by Omyla (1994). Apparently quite independently, following a suggestion of Prior (1957), Cresswell constructed a second-order theory of intensional identity. Besides the difference of level, in Suszko’s system identity is a primitive symbol introduced axiomatically, whereas in Cresswell’s system identity is defined by:
p = q ≡ ∀f (f(p) ≡ f(q)) (3.17)
where functorial variables are allowed to range over non-extensional functors as well. The question of the relation between Cresswell’s and Suszko’s systems has not been fully explored. Also, Suszko at one point suggests that Protothetic would have been much more interesting if it had admitted the intensional identity. No such extension of Protothetic has been constructed so far. Another fascinating issue seems to be the relation between intensional identity and modalities. In his papers Suszko also shows how in some systems with identity as the only primitive non-extensional system it is possible to obtain various modal calculi.
