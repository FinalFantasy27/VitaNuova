Philosophical logic
individualism
1. There is no \Gamma \subset \mathcal L_{ind} such that \Gamma is satisfiable and \Gamma is (deductively) sufficient for ⭐G
2. There is no \Gamma \subset \mathcal L_{ind} such that \Gamma is non-valid and \Gamma is (deductively) necessary for ⭐G
Proof Sketch.construct two probabilistic game models (M_1,b) and (M_2,c) such that 
1. (M_1,b) and (M_2,c) satisfy exactly the same individualistic formulas
2. Group G performs a group action that maximizes expected utility in (M_1,b) 
3. Group G performs a group action that does not maximize expected utility in (M_1,c)
There is no logical regularity between a particular social statement \sigma and statements in a specific individualistic language \mathcal L_{ind}
So, there are no reductive explanations of the social statement \sigma in the individualistic language \mathcal L_{ind}
E.g. G = {i,j}
1. If agents i and j together see to it that \phi, then agent i sees to it that \phi and agent j sees to it that \phi? No
a payoff martix (a1,a2)|=[G]p \land \lnot[i]p.
a \models [i]p iff for all b \in A=×_{i\in N}A_i the set of action profiles with b_i=a_i it holds that b\models p
2. If agents i and j together ought to see to it that \phi, then agent i ought to see to it that \phi and agent j ought to see to it that \phi? No
· If agent i fulfils her obligations and agent j fulfils her obligations, then agents i and j together fulfil their collective obligations? No, and no for the converse
