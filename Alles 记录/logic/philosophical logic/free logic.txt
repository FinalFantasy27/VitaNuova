declare as false an atomic formula of the form P^n_i t_1,â€¦,t_n or t_i=t_j if any of the terms involve fail to denote anything in the domain. That would result in a negative model theory for the language. On the other hand, we could make allowance for true atomic formulas even if some of the relevant terms denote nothing in the domain, e.g., we might declare t=t true even if nothing in the domain of quantification is a denotation for the term in question. That would result in a positive model theory for the language. Finally, we could declare atomic formulas not of the form E!t to be neither true nor false, which would result in a neutral model theory for the language.
