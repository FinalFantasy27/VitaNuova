Barrier theorem: no set containing only sentences of one kind entails a sentence of another kind, for example, the claim that no set containing only descriptive sentences entails a normative sentence, or the claim that no set containing only particular sentences entails a universal one, or no set containing only past and now sentences entails a future sentences. 

Prove an indexical barrier theorem.

Difficulties: 1. FI will fail to count as indexical on Definition and \forall v Fv deduces F I.
2. Is contingency a kind of indexicality? (Lewis and MacFarlane hold that it is)
3. context-sensitivity by varying the context of utterance (indexicality) vs. varying what
the world is like (varying the circumstance of evaluation) 
And Fa deduces NFa, AFa, ANFa, N for "Now" and A for "Actually".
But this also hints at a possible non?ad hoc solution to both this problem and the problem of contingency: the barrier only holds for a restricted kind of indexicality, indexicals whose content varies with an element of the context of utterance that is not also a part of the circumstance of evaluation. In Kaplan formal model, 'I' and 'Here' are of the relevant restricted kind, whereas 'N' and 'A' are not.
