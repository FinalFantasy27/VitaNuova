Formulae of Propositional Logic
Definition 1.  ... Only these are formulae.
2. the intersection of ...
3. h_0 = {p_k | k \in N}, h_{n+1} = ..., \underline{i \in \omega}\Cup h_i
4. A formula has a formation sequence. A formation sequence for a formula Y is a finite sequence Y_1, \dots, Y_m such that Y_m is Y and for each 1 \le i \le m, one of the following conditions holds:
(a) Y_i is a propositional variabel;
(b) there is j < i such that Y_i is ~Y_j;
(c) there are indices j<i and k<i such that Y_i is [Y_jâˆ¨Y_k].
