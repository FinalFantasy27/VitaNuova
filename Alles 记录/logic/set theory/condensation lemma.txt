In set theory, a branch of mathematics, the condensation lemma is a result about sets in the constructible universe.

It states that if X is a transitive set and is an elementary submodel of some level of the constructible hierarchy Lα, that is, { (X,\in )\prec (L_{\alpha },\in )}, then in fact there is some ordinal { \beta \leq \alpha } such that {X=L_{\beta }}.

More can be said: If X is not transitive, then its transitive collapse is equal to some L_{\beta }, and the hypothesis of elementarity can be weakened to elementarity only for formulas which are \Sigma _{1} in the Lévy hierarchy. Also, the assumption that X be transitive automatically holds when {\alpha =\omega _{1}}.

The lemma was formulated and proved by Kurt Gödel in his proof that the axiom of constructibility implies GCH.
