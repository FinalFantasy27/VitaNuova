Kuratowski proof:

Set theory cannot prove that set theory is consistent in the strong sense
that some *V*α is a model of set theory. For suppose it does. Then there is
α such that *V*α is a model of set theory. Hence there is also in *V*α some
β<α such that *V*βis a model of set theory. Continuing in this way we get
an infinite descending sequence of ordinals, a contradiction.
