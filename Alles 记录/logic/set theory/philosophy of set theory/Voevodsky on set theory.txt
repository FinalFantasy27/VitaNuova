“Set theory will remain the most important benchmark of consistency. . . . each new addition to the . . . language will require formal ‘certification’ by showing, through formally constructed interpretation, that it is at least as consistent as ZFC.Univalent foundations provide a new approach to the formal reasoning about mathematical objects. The languages which arise in this approach are much more convenient for doing serious mathematics than ZFC at the cost of being much more complex. In particular, the consistency issues for these languages are not intuitively clear. Thus ZFC retains its key role as the theory which is used [to] ensure that the more and more complex languages of the univalent approach are consistent.”（Voevodsky）
