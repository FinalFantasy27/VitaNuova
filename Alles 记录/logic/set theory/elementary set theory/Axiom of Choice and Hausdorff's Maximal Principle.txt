Axiom of Choice implies Hausdorff's Maximal Principle

Let S be the set of all chains of P.
S≠∅ since the empty set is an element of S. 
From Subset Relation is Ordering, we have that (S,⊆) is partially ordered by inclusion.
Let C be a totally ordered subset of (S,⊆).
Then ⋃C is a chain in C by Set of Chains is Closed under Chain Unions under Subset Relation.
This shows that S, ordered by set inclusion, is an inductive ordered subset.
By applying Zorn's Lemma, the result follows.

Hausdorff's Maximal Principle implies Axiom of Choice

Let Hausdorff's Maximal Principle be accepted.
Let S be a non-empty set.
Let Σ be the set of all choice functions of all non-empty subsets of S.
From Countable Set has Choice Function every finite subset of S has a choice function.
Hence Σ is a non-empty set.

Lemma. Σ is closed under chain unions.

By Hausdorff's Maximal Principle it follows that Σ has a maximal element f. Hence f is seen to be a choice function for S.
