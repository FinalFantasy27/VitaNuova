ZFC without parameters is equivalent to ZFC.

0, 1都是无参数可定义的，F(x)=(x,0) ...也是无参数可定义的

For all sets a and b, the set {((u, 0), (b, 1)) : u ∈ a} exists.
Let F(x) = 0 unless there are u and c with x = ((u, 0), (c, 1)), and \phi(x, c) in which case F(((u, 0), (c, 1))) = u. Then {x ∈ a: φ(x, b)} ∪ {0} = F''{((u, 0), (b, 1)) : u ∈ a}

using Par将这些参数编码成一个有限函数

In page 247, he wrote:

Levy’s main, negative results addressed another issue of self-refinement in axiomatics and showed that his aforementioned positive result is reasonably sharp. In the presence of Separation the generative axioms are sometimes given parsimoniously in a weaker, conditional form, e.g. $\forall u \exists y \forall x (x \subseteq u \to x \in y) $ for the Power Set Axiom. With his positive result, the set $\sf T $ consisting of the usual $\sf ZF$ axioms, but with the Separation schema replaced by $S_0$ and the Replacement schema replaced by the conditional version, is an axiomatization of $\sf ZF$. Levy established that full Separation is not a consequence of $\sf T$ if the Power Set axiom is weakened to the conditional form. He also established the analogous results for the conditional version of Union and the conditional version of Pairing.
