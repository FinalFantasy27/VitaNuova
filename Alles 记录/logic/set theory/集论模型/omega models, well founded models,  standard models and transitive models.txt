A model of ZFC is a pair (M,E) such that M is non-empty and E is well-founded, and (M,E)⊨ZFC. Using Mostowski's collapse lemma this is isomorphic to a transitive set, N such that (N,∈↾N)⊨ZFC.

Given any standard model (M, \in_M)  of ZF we can construct an isomorphic non-standard model (M*, E*)  quite easily by taking M* = {{x} : x \in M} , and defining {x} E * {y} <=> x \in y. This model will be well-founded.

There are several different senses in which a set model of ZF set theory could be "standard". I have marked this answer as community wiki, so please feel free to add any other definitions that you think of.

1The model could have an \omega  that is isomorphic to the standard \omega. These models are called omega-models.

2The membership relation of the model could be well founded when viewed from the outside. These models are called well founded models.

3The model could use the standard membership relation  rather than some other membership relation. These models are sometimes called standard models.

4The model could be a transitive set, and use the standard membership relation . These models are called transitive models.

For any given model, (4) implies (3) implies (2) implies (1), and none of the converse implications hold in general.

The Mostowski collapse lemma shows that every model of ZF satisfying (2) is isomorphic to a model satisfying (4).
