 (*)    If S is a PA-derivation, then S is not a proof of 0=1.

is already provable in R. (These are \Delta_1, and they are all true.)

(可以在Kaye的Models of Peano Arithmetic找到证明):

对于任意自然数s...s0, PA都能证明"s...s0不是0=1的证明的编码".

 我们称一个包含PA的理论T为omega-incomplete的, 当且仅当对于某个语句phix, 可以证明phi0, phi s0, phi ss0, ... 但是T不可以证明\forall x \in N phi (n). 则我们讨论的结果就是: ZFC和PA都是omega-incomplete的.


Tarski, Mostowski and Robinson showed that R is a good base theory for G1.
