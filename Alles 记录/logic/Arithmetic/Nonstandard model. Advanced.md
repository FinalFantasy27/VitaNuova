The main focus of Hans Schoutens’s talk for the CUNY Logic Workshop on March 2, 2018 was the question, for a given algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero and a given model of arithmetic $\Gamma\vdash$PA, whether $\Gamma$ and $k$ were jointly realizable as the set of powers (as he defines it) and the set of units of a model $S$ of the generalized theory of polynomial rings over fields. 
The topic of Hans Schoutens talk was in part the idea of looking at $M$’s version of the polynomial ring $\bar{\mathbb{Q}}^M[x]$. So this field does not have only standard-finite polynomials, but nonstandard polynomials as well. And he observed that $M$ is definable inside this nonstandard polynomial ring as the semi-ring of “exponents”, corresponding to the powers $x^n$ for $n\in M$. These polynomials are definable in that ring.
