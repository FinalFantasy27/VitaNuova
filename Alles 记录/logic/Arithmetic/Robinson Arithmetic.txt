T_0 is a finite theory extending Robinson's Q.

Theorem 1. Let L be any formal system with a recursive set of axioms, a finite number of finitary and recursive rules of inference including modus ponens and having A→A as a theorem for all sentences A. Let
ConL=df¬(∃y,z)(ThL(y)∧ThL(z)∧neg(z,y))
where ThL, neg are given in Definition 3 below. Then ConL is not provable in T_0. 

"We must agree with Kreisel that this is devoid of any philosophical interest and that in such a weak system this formula cannot be said to express consistency but only an algebraic property which in a stronger system (e.g. Peano arithmetic P) could reasonably be said to express the consistency of Q."
