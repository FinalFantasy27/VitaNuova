Abstract: 1."The model-theoretic definition of satisfaction and truth given by Tarski and Vaught in the 1950s adapts the two-level 1933 definition to three-level model-theoretic languages." 
In 1930s, Tarski worked in a fixed structure, namely, the class of all individuals. And his object language is a pure second-order calculus, where the satisfication of a sentence φ is defined as the truth of a second-order sentence, which is a result of replacing each nonlogical constant in φ with second-order bound variable. 
He didn't introduce the term 'model' until 1936, and he never spoke of a sentence being 'true in a model' before the 1950s. 
Hodges hypothesizes that the development of the new technique known as 'model theory' by Tarski and his colleagues was prompted by the necessity for a fresh approach, driven by the emergence of new results involving two or more structures. 
"Various styles of model-theoretic truth definition are proposed by Kemeny [15] in 1948, Tarski [38] in 1950 and Mostowski [21] in 1952. (In his 1948 text [20] Mostowski faithfully followed the definitions of [33]. McKinsey’s truth definition [18] in 1947 is earlier evidence of experiment but it does not address the need to develop a model-theoretic version.) Tarski and Vaught [42] published the definitive model theoretictruth definition in 1957; they ascribe ‘most of’ the relevant section to Tarski’." 

2. Hodges asserts that recursive definitions are not essential in Tarski's truth definition, as it can be reformulated in an explicit form. Instead, what is required is compositional semantics. 

3. Satisfication, as well as recursive style of definition, are both consequences of the fact that his 1933 truth definition is a fregean cover of truth. 
There are instances of truth definitions that are extensionally equivalent to Tarski's, such as game semantics, but they are not function as a Fregean cover of truth. Additionally, there are languages that have a Fregean cover of truth, allowing for a recursive truth definition, but lack a truth definition where the semantic values of formulas are defined in terms of the assignments that satisfy them, as seen in independence-friendly logic.
