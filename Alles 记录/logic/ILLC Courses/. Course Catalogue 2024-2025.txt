Logic
Programme
In order to obtain the MSc Logic degree, a student needs to pass at total of at least 120 EC, consisting of:

1. Core components(at least 72 EC):

Obligatory components: the courses Logic, Language and Computation and Mathematical Proof Methods for Logic  (unless exempted) and the track-specific obligatory courses for at least one of the four tracks;
Research projects: Every student must have at least 6 and at most 24 EC in research projects. During the final month of each semester, the MSc Logic offers projects for this purpose. However, students can also organise individual research projects with a member of staff of their choice. Credits for any learning activity that is not taught in the usual style of courses and/or that is not part of a regular Master's programme of a university, like for examples internships and summer schools, are counted towards the maximum of 24 EC in research projects.
Electives: a sufficient number of elective courses from the list of MSc Logic courses.
2. The Thesis Master of Logic (30 EC). The Thesis Master of Logic is written under the supervision of a member of staff at the ILLC. The student should start discussing possible topics with staff members in his or her third semester (in close consultation with his or her academic mentor) and agree with a supervisor on a thesis topic and plan by the end of the third semester. The thesis defense (in the presence of a thesis committee) is the final examination of the MSc Logic.

3. Free choice (18 EC): students may choose components from other Masterâ€™s programmes. There is no limit on the number of free-choice electives that a student can take, as long as the curriculum meets the requirements mentioned above (in particular, the curriculum must have at least 72 EC in core components).
Taking a course as free-choice elective does not require any prior permission from the Examinations Board. 

In addition, students are expected to attend at least 10 research talks before starting work on their thesis. These talks could be talks at a workshop or conference in Amsterdam or a talk in one of the regular meetings of the research seminars at the ILLC, e.g., the Logic Tea, the DIP Colloquium, or the Computational Linguistics Seminar.
