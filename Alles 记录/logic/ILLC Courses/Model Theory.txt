 
Model Theory

	
prof.dr. Y. Venema (co-ordinator)

Contents
In this course we will give a general introduction to the methods and results of classical model theory. More concretely, we will cover the following topics:

Basic notions: diagrams, compactness, Loewenheim-Skolem Theorem, model comparison games
Classical model theory: ultraproducts, preservation theorems, quantifier elimination
Types: type spaces, saturation, omitting types, omega-categoricity
Recommended prior knowledge
We presuppose some (but very little) background knowledge in logic; roughly, what is needed is familiarity with the syntax and semantics of first-order languages. Familiarity with elementary notions from set theory (ordinals, cardinals) is required. Some basic knowledge of topology will be handy, and familiarity with algebraic structures (such as rings, fields, and vector spaces) will be useful in order to be able to appreciate some of the examples; none of these will be essential, however. More importantly, we assume that participants in the course possess some mathematical maturity, as can be expected from students in mathematics or logic at the MSc level.
