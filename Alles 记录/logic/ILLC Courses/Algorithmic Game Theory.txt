Algorithmic Game Theory

Lecturer(s)

G. Schaefer (co-ordinator)

Contents
the existence, computation and inefficiency of equilibria (ranging from pure Nash equilibria to learning outcomes) for various classes of games
the problem of designing coordination mechanisms to reduce the inefficiency
touch upon the computational limitations that arise in classic auction theory, and learn about techniques to develop simple and efficient algorithms for fundamental mechanism design problems

topics (tentative list):

selfish routing games and the price of anarchy
Braess paradox, Stackelberg routing, network tolls
best-response dynamics and potential games
existence, computation and inefficiency of equilibria
equilibrium hierarchy, smoothness and extension theorems
sponsored search and combinatorial auctions
simple vs. optimal mechanism design
matching markets and envy-freeness
cost sharing mechanisms

Recommended prior knowledge
Solid knowledge of complexity theory, algorithms and optimization
