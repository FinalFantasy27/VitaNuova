Type Theory

	
dr. B. van den Berg (co-ordinator)

Objectives
Encode mathematical proofs in type theory
Prove properties about type theories
Contents
Type theory is a subject which lies at the intersection of mathematics, logic and computer science. In this course the emphasis will be on how type theory can be used as a framework for developing mathematics and verifying mathematical proofs. We will discuss various version of the lambda calculus (untyped, simply typed, second order typed and dependently typed). The course will culminate in the Calculus of Constructions (CoC) and investigate how that provides a setting for formalising mathematics.

Recommended prior knowledge
None. We will only assume some basic familiarity with logical systems and mathematical proofs.
