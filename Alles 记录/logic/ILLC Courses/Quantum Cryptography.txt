Contents
Quantum computing has important implications for the field of cryptography. On the one hand, techniques in quantum information open up new possibilities for secure communication (e.g. quantum key distribution), while on the other hand, achieving security might be harder in a world where attackers potentially possess quantum computers.

The aim of this course is to familiarize students with a variety of topics within quantum cryptography, so that they are able to read and understand research papers in the field. We will study quantum key distribution in more detail, consider hardware limitations, as well as cryptographic primitives such as oblivious transfer, bit commitment and secret sharing in a quantum setting. In particular, we will highlight the differences with the classical setting for these tasks. There will also be time to study recent developments based on the interest of the students.

Recommended prior knowledge
Basic knowledge of quantum information, as covered in the courses Quantum Computing by Ronald de Wolf or Quantum Information by Maris Ozols. In particular, the required background material corresponds to Chapters 1,2 of Ronald de Wolfâ€™s lecture notes, or Chapter 0 of the linked lecture notes in the listed literature.
