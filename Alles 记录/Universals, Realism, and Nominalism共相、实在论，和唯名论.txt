History
the demise of predicate nominalism as a viable account of properties and relations 

Realism about universals is certainly on the rise

- a sparse theory of properties – that is to say, it is not the case that to every definable predicate there corresponds a genuine universal 
-- traditional a priori metaphysics of properties (e.g. Bealer 1982) 
-- a more empiricist, scientifically informed approach (e.g. Armstrong 1978, Tooley 1977). 
--- According to Armstrong, for example, which predicates pick out genuine universals is a matter for developed science. The primitive predicates of our best fundamental physical theory will give us our best guess at what the genuine universals in nature are. They might be predicates like electron or mass, or more likely something even more abstruse and remote from the phenomena – like the primitives of String Theory

--- Maybe whether the universals enter into genuine causal relations will be crucial
