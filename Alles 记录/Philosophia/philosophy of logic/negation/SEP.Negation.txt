Negation by iteration
The idea of negation by iteration is to obtain a negation by a double application of a connective called “demi-negation” in Humberstone 1995, 2000b, or “square root of negation” in quantum computational logic, see, for recent references, Dalla Chiara, Giuntini, Leporini, and Sergioli 2018, Paoli 2019, and the entry on sentence connectives in formal logic. This clearly reminds one of the duplex negatio negat in negative concord, see Section 1.8.2.
Perfect negation
Perfect negation is a rather restrictive notion of negation that has been developed by Avron (1999, 2002) in terms of proof-theoretical as well as semantic conditions.
2.5 Negation, rejection, and denial
Frege (1919) and Geach (1965): Ripley (2011b, 623) calls the denial equivalence:

that to assert the negation of a content A is equivalent, in its conversational effects and commitments carried, to denying A.

“rejectivism” defended by, for example, Price (1983, 1990), Smiley (1996), and Rumfitt (2000): the conceptual priority of the notions of assertion and denial over the concept of negation
see also Lloyd Humberstone (2000a: 331)
Ripley (2011b) remarks, rejectivists are typically inferentialists

Frege’s argument that an account of negation in terms of denial does not make sense of embedded negations
Humberstone (2000a, Footnote 10): “Bendall normal form”, namely a formula that contains at most one occurrence of the negation sign as the principal connective
The normal form result holds for classical propositional logic (CPL) in the connectives ∼, ∧, ∨, and →. It fails for the negation, conjunction, disjunction fragment of CPL...
An in-depth investigation of sequent calculi using formulas prefixed by an assertion sign [+] or a rejection sign [–], understood as non-embeddable force indicators, can be found in Bendall 1978, Humberstone 2000a.

Another way of repulsing the denial equivalence is to argue that denial and rejection are conceptually independent from the concept of negation. Such an independence is defended, for example in van der Sandt and Maier 2003 (Other Internet Resources) and Priest 2006, Chapter 6.
A critical discussion of this approach may be found in Ripley 2011b.
