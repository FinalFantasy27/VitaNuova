There is no first-order derivation of a contradiction from Yablo's premisses and the Tarski biconditionals.
Yablo's paradox requires an infinite number of instances of the T-schema. Yablo's paradox will not go through if we limit ourselves to only a finite number of such instances.
Even with all of the relevant T-biconditionals, the Yablo sentences are only omega inconsistent.
However, an explicit contradiction could be deduced if we had, not the T-biconditionals,
but the following generalization of them: forall n[Sn is true -> forall j>n(Sj is untrue)]. The point is that while the Liar paradox may be seen as stemming from an inconsistency in the T-biconditionals themselves, Yablo's paradox may not.
