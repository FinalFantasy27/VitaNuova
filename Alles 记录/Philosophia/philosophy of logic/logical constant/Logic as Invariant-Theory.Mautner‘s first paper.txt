If I have a set X with n elements, I can see how a subgroup of S_n acts on the Boolean algebras, P(X), P(X^2), P(X^3), ... Logical terms arise from orbits of the full group S_n . So, for example, in P(X^2) , the atoms are ordered pairs, and they fall into four orbits, corresponding to the empty set, the universal set, x=y and x \not= y. Hence, equality is a logical notion.

Todd and Jim had the advantage of hyperdoctrines and the Beck-Chevalley condition to handle the relations between different P(X^i).
