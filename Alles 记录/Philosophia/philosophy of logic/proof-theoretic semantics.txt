Thus the meaning of “&” can be grasped by anyone who understands the significance of the horizontal line in an inference rule. (Contrast “%” from the last section, which cannot be grasped by anyone who does not understand what a male is and what a widow is.) 

Gentzen (1935, §5.13; 1969, 80) holds that a constant is defined by its introduction rules, and that the elimination rules are just consequences of these. This idea is developed further in Prawitz 1985 and Dummett 1991. Koslow (1992, 1999) takes the elimination rules as fundamental, defining each logical operation as the weakest object in an implication structure that satisfies the elimination rule. Kneale (1956, 257) uses two-way (reversible) sequent rules, both left and right. Hodes (2004, 143) takes the introduction rules to be fundamental for some constants, the elimination rules for others (and in some cases, he holds, neither is fundamental).

The strictest criterion would allow only rules in which every sign, besides a single instance of the constant being characterized, is either structural (like the comma) or schematic (like “A”). But although this condition is met by the standard rules for conjunction, it is not met by the natural deduction introduction rule for negation, which must employ either another logical constant (“⊥”) or another instance of the negation sign than the one being introduced. Thus one must either relax the condition for being “purely inferential” or add more structure (see especially Belnap 1982).


For example, if we use single-conclusion sequents with the standard rules for the constants, we get the intuitionistic connectives, while if we use multiple-conclusion sequents, we get the classical connectives (Kneale 1956, 253). If we adopt Došen’s constraints on acceptable rules (Došen 1994, 280), the S4 necessity operator gets counted as a logical constant, while if we adopt Hacking’s constraints, it doesn’t (Hacking 1979, 297). 

Prawitz (1985; 2005) argues that any formally suitable introduction rule can fix the meaning for a logical constant. On Prawitz’s view, the lesson we learn from Prior is that we cannot also stipulate an elimination rule, but must justify any proposed elimination rule by showing that there is a procedure for rearranging any direct proof of the premises of the elimination rule into a direct proof of the conclusion. Thus, we can stipulate the introduction rule for “tonk”, but must then content ourselves with the strongest elimination rule for which such a procedure is available:
A
---
A tonk B;
A tonk B
---
B

the idea that the introduction and elimination rules that fix the meaning of a constant must be in harmony: the elimination rules must not permit us to infer more from a compound sentence than would be justified by the premises of the corresponding introduction rules (Dummett 1981, 396; Tennant 1987, 76-98). (For analyses of various notions of harmony, and their relation to notions like normalizability and conservativeness, see Milne 1994, Read 2010, and Steinberger 2011.)
