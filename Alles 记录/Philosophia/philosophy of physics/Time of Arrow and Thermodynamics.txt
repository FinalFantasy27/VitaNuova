The Second Law The (thermodynamic) entropy of a closed system (typically) does not decrease over time.
the Past Hypothesis (Albert (2000)).in a universe with wide-spread temporal asymmetries, postulate a low-entropy initial condition
Boltzmann (1964)[1898]§89 (though he ultimately seems to favor what may be called the Fluctuation Hypothesis) and has many advocates: Feynman et al. (2011, 46-5)[1963], Feynman (2017)[1965], Lebowitz (2008), Penrose (1979), Albert (2000), Callender (2004), North (2011),Wallace (2011), Loewer (2016, 2020), and Goldstein et al. (2020)

Some philosophers, such asWinsberg (2004) and Earman (2006), have raised technical
objections against the explanation. See Earman (2006) for some worries about the Past Hypothesis as a hypothesis about the initial condition for the universe. See Goldstein et al. (2016) for a discussion about the possibility and some recent examples, of explaining the arrow of time without the Past Hypothesis.
