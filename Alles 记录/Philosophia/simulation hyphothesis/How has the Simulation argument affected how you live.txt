How To Live In A Simulation 
2001 

Journal of Evolution and Technology , Vol. 7 

Abstract: If you might be living in a simulation then all else equal you should care less about others, live more for today, make your world look more likely to become rich, expect to and try more to participate in pivotal events, be more entertaining and praiseworthy, and keep the famous people around you happier and more interested in you.

Barely. (Except, of course, it has affected my work in one particular research area.)

The original paper has some discussion of various potential practical implications of the simulation-hypothesis, and Robin Hanson has also published a paper on this. My view on Hansonâ€™s paper is that the considerations he point out may well be sound as far as they go, but they are quite weak and in some parts counterbalanced or outweighed by other considerations (such as the ones explored in my paper). The upshot, I think, is that the simulation-hypothesis currently does not seem to have any radical implications for how one should live, although there might be a multitude of weak or subtle implications. The practical impact of these is of course further modulated by the possibility that the simulation-hypothesis is false.

The simulation argument does, however, narrow down the set of tenable possibilities and by doing so it helps to shed light on, among other things, the prospects of our species. It is also conceivable that, when combined with other considerations or arguments, some of which may yet to be discovered, it could have significant implications for our individual or collective planning.
