Spinoza, you are my everything!

I have been looking for substance
That is possibly word I need
A man with a big axiom
Define this love for me

Baby let me demonstrate
The passion that I feel
I know that you believe in fate

Baby I need your affections
I want I conceive myself through you
Your attribute is so, so attractive
All of these propositions are true

But I am too scared to tell you
So please please proposition me
Except you, my love, no substance can be conceived 

Spinoza you are my everything!

（说）Baby I need you love
Spinoza baby can't you see
We need to be together baby
I am a part of you baby
And you are, a part of me
