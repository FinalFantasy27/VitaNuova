Crash course on quantities and measurement theory 
2011 
Measurement theory uses numbers to represent quantities.
Proof skteches of a representation theorem to the effect that homomorphisms from relational structures (<A,>=,C>) to mathematical structures (<R,>=,+>) and a uniqueness theorem that any two homomorphisms are scalar multiples of each other are given. (transitivity, no infinitely massive object and Archimedean assumption assumed)

The philosophers of science who developed measurement theory were largely concerned with epistemic questions like: we can’t observe correlations between physical objects and real numbers, so how can the use of real numbers be
justied in terms of things we can observe? As we saw, the metaphysical concerns about quantity are different; but they too can be addressed using measurement theory.

Problem 1 What are the fundamental facts of quantity like, which enable them to be spoken of and theorized about using numbers?
Problem 2 What is the deciency of statements of quantity that “don’t make sense” because of missing quantitative structure?
1. The mass of object o is 5
5. The mass of object o is greater than the charge of object p
• Possible answer to problem 1: the fundamental relations for a quantity are those relations in the nonmathematical structures ( and C in the
case of mass). Talk of numbers is useful (and justied) because of the homomorphisms.
• Possible answer to problem 2: there are insufcient fundamental relations to prove the uniqueness theorems, in cases of insufcient structure
