Crash course on natural necessity 
2018 

1. Natural necessity
2. Concepts of natural necessity
3. Which concept of natural necessity is most fundamental?
4.Quidditism vs nomic/causal/dispositional essentialism
5. Laws
5.1 Regularity theory
5.2 Best-system theory
5.3 The primitive operator theory
5.4 The Armstrong/Dretske/Tooley theory: laws as relations between universals
Whatever N may be, I cannot see how it could be absolutely impossible to have N(F,G) and F a without Ga. (Unless N just is constant conjunction, or constant conjunction plus something else, in which case Armstrong’s
theory turns into a form of the regularity theory he rejects.) The mystery is somewhat hidden by Armstrong’s terminology. He uses ‘necessitates’
as a name for the lawmaking universal N; and who would be surprised to hear that if F ‘necessitates’ G and a has F , then a must have G? But I say that N deserves the name of ‘necessitation’ only if, somehow, it really can
enter into the requisite necessary connections. It can’t enter into them just by bearing a name, any more than one can have mighty biceps just by
being called ‘Armstrong’ (Lewis (1983, p. 366)).

6. Quidditism and laws
the regularity theory, the best system theory, and the DTA theory—more or less presuppose quidditism.
7. Objections to quidditism
7.1 “Distinctions without differences”
8. Categorical properties unknowable?
9. Shoemaker’s epistemic argument
