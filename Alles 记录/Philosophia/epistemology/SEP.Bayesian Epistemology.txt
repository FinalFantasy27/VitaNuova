Some Bayesians who have tried to solve this problem (e.g., Garber) have typically tried to weaken the logical omniscience assumption to allow for the possibility of discovering logical relations (e.g., that H and suitable auxiliary assumptions imply E). As mentioned above, relaxing the logical omniscience assumption threatens to block the derivation of almost all of the important results in Bayesian epistemology. Other Bayesians (e.g., Lange) employ the Bayesian formalism as a tool in the rational reconstruction of the evidentiary support for a scientific hypothesis, where it is irrelevant to the rational reconstruction whether the evidence was discovered before or after the theory was initially formulated. Joyce and Christensen agree that discovering new logical relations between previously accepted evidence and a theory cannot raise the probability of the theory. However, they suggest that using Pi(H/E) âˆ’ Pi(H/-E) as a measure of support can at least explain how evidence that has probability one could still support a theory. Eells and Fitelson have criticized this proposal and argued that the problem is better addressed by distinguishing two measures, the historical measure of the degree to which a piece of evidence E actually confirmed an hypothesis H and the ahistorical measure of how much a piece of evidence E would support an hypothesis H, on given background information B. The second measure enables us to ask the ahistorical question of how much E would support H if we had no other evidence supporting H.
