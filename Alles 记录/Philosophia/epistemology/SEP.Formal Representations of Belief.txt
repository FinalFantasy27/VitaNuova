The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2022 Edition), Edward N. Zalta & Uri Nodelman (eds.)

1. Preliminaries
1.1 Why Formalism?
1.2 The Objects of Belief and their Structure
2. Representations of Full Belief
2.1 Non-monotonic Logic
2.2 AGM Belief Revision
2.3 Epistemic Logic
3. Representations of Partial Belief
3.1 Subjective Probability Theory
Central to the literature on decision theory are a number of representation theorems showing that every agent with qualitative preferences satisfying a set of rationality postulates can be represented as an expected utility maximizer (von Neumann and Morgenstern, 1944 and Savage, 1972). These axioms are controversial
3.2 Imprecise Probability Theory
van Fraasen, 1990, Levi 1974 propose that a belief state is better represented by a set of probability functions
3.2 Dempster-Shafer Theory
subjective probability function Pr(A)+Pr(B)=Pr(A \Cup B)
DS belief function B(A) + B(B) <= B(A \Cup B)
3.3 Possibility and Plausibility Theory
possibility measure \Pi(A) + \Pi(B) >= \Pi(A \Cup B)
3.4 Ranking Theory
pointwise ranking function κ: N \Cup {\infty}
ranking function \rho: A -> N \Cup {\infty} on the field A by setting 
\rho(A) = min {\kappa(w): w \in A}
\rho(A \Cup B) = min{\rho(A), \rho(B)} 
says that a disjunction A∪B should be disbelieved just in case both disjuncts are disbelieved
