In “Evolution and Moral Realism,” Kim Sterelny and Ben Fraser argue that it need not. They chart a middle course between moral error theory on the one hand and full vindication of our folk moral beliefs on the other. Their version of reductive naturalism grounds moral truths in facts about how humans best cooperate. Over time, our folk moral theories track— imperfectly, to be sure—objective facts about what makes for profitable and stable cooperation. This provides a partial vindication of our folk moral theories, they argue, much in the way that ancient Greek astronomy is partially vindicated by its predictive and observational successes, despite being largely false propositionally. Their view has a number of interesting consequences. By basing morality on facts about cooperation, moral epistemology becomes much less mysterious: we often have easy access to facts about social cooperation, what works well and what does not. Furthermore, moral facts become counterfactually sensitive to facts about cooperation: if we lived in a world where optimal cooperation required cruel punishment, then the moral standing of cruelty would change accordingly. Nevertheless, due to the complex and error-prone process of arriving at true moral beliefs, their view has ample resources to ward off charges of moral relativism. All moral beliefs result from social learning, but only some moral beliefs are true, they argue, based on standing in the proper causal relation to the social structures and personal dispositions that help (or hinder) humans from cooperating in a manner that is fair, trustworthy, and committed
