爱因斯坦受到的哲学的影响：
对我来说，尤其是通过阅读大卫·休谟和恩斯特·马赫的哲学著作，发现（）所需的批判性推理得到了决定性的推进
The type of critical reasoning required for the discovery of this central point was decisively furthered, in my case, especially by the reading of David Hume’s and Ernst Mach’s philosophical writings.
from the sixth page of “Notes for an Autobiography,” published in The Saturday Review of Lit er a ture on November 26, 1949, which is a shortened version of the autobiographical statement in Einstein (1948).

在回复石里克的信中也说：
你也正确地看到，这种思想对我的努力产生了巨大的影响，实际上马赫对我的影响更大，而还要大的是休谟，在发现相对论前不久，我怀着热切和钦佩的心情研读了休谟的《人性论》。
Also you have correctly seen that this line of thought was of great influence on my efforts and indeed Mach and still much more Hume, whose Treatise on Human Nature I studied with eagerness and admiration shortly before finding relativity theory.

我昨天收到了你（石里克）的论文，并进行了深入研究。这是迄今为止关于相对论的最好的文章之一。关于相对论的哲学方面，以前还没有人写得如此清楚。同时，你对理论本身也有充分的掌握。. . .

I received your paper yesterday, and have studied it thoroughly. It’s among the best yet of what’s been writ ten about relativity. Nothing nearly as clear has previ ously been written about its philosophical aspects. At the same time you have full command of the theory itself. . . .
