. . . consider an object, . . . what is an object? Philosophers are always saying, "WelI, just take a chair for exaruple." The moment they say that, you know they do not know what they are talking about any more. What is a chair? WelI, a chair is a certain thing over there ... certain?, how certain? The atoms are evaporating from it from time to time-not many atoms, but a few-dirt falIs on it and gets dissolved in the paint; so to define a chair precisely, to say exactly which atoms are chair, and which atoms are air, or which atoms are dirt, or which atoms are paint that belongs to the chair is impossible.
