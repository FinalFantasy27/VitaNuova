A 2014 CBC Radio documentary described how they can feel and taste what the other is experiencing.
The Hogan Sisters cannot control the shared experience; when one feels, the other always feels.
"Listen to this short clip to find out what happens when only one twin likes ketchup."
Like every other child, they do fight each other sometimes.

Their brains are connected by a thalamic bridge, connecting the thalamus of one with that of the other. The thalamus acts like a switchboard relaying sensory and motor signals and regulating consciousness.
Krista and Tatiana Hogan share the senses of touch and taste and even control one another’s limbs. Tatiana can see out of both of Krista’s eyes, while Krista can only see out of one of Tatiana’s.
Tatiana controls three arms and a leg, while Krista controls three legs and an arm. They can also switch to self-control of their limbs.
The twins say they know one another’s thoughts without having to speak. “Talking in our heads” is how they describe it.
The girls are diabetic and have epilepsy. They take a regimen of pills, blood tests and need daily insulin injections.
The girls have very different personalities. Tatiana is outgoing, talkative and high strung while Krista is quieter, more relaxed and loves to tell jokes.
The twins go to a regular school and as of September 2017 have started Grade 6. Though academically delayed, they are learning to read, write and do arithmetic.
The girls ride a specially-built bicycle, zoom down hills on toboggans, cross country ski and, as part of their physical therapy, are learning to swim.
