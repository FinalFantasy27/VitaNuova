Who owns the body if it is under the control of two wills? Is it even intelligible to consider property under duel ownership of two wills? Are there limits of a dominant twin based on the demands of the  other  twin?  Could  one  twin  commit  a  crime  while  the  other  was innocent?  What,  if  any,  are  the  limits  of  restitution  and  punishment regarding conjoined twins? Could one twin legally end his life if it meant the  end  of  both  of  their  lives?  Could  one  twin  enter  into  a  contract without the consent of the other.
