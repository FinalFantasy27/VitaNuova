a “surgical” change in A
 which is of such a character that if any change occurs in B
, it occurs only as a result of its causal connection, if any, to A
 and not in any other way. In other words, the change in B
, if any, that is produced by the manipulation of A
 should be produced only via a causal route that goes through A
. Manipulations or changes in the value of a variable that have the right sort of surgical features have come to be called interventions in the recent literature (e.g., Spirtes, Glymour, and Scheines 2000; Meek and Glymour 1994; Hausman 1998; Pearl 2009; Woodward 1997, 2000, 2003; Woodward and Hitchcock 2003; Cartwright 2003)
