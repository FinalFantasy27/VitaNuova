As an illustration, Halpern (2016): X=x is an actual cause of Y=y in world w just in case X belongs to a minimal set of variables X, such that when we intervene to hold the variables in Z fixed at the values they actually take in w, Y counterfactually depends upon the values of the variables in X.
which can deal with preemption and overdetermination
Despite these successes, none of the analyses of actual causation developed so far perfectly captures our pre-theoretic intuitions in every case.
