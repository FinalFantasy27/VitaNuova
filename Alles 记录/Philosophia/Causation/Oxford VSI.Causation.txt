Hume 
regularity, David Lewis' mosaic picure 
If A occurs only five times...; necessity events 
Russell 1913 'On the Notion of Cause' in physics causation has place, physical equations is symmetrical. 
If physical theory lacks an account of causation, it may be that our physical theory is not complete. 
Hume: temporal priority and contiguity (spatially adjacent) 
in tension 
chain of intermediate causes and effects 
Kant: simultaneity 
Non-locality 
Spinoza's definition of causation: 'From a given definite cause an effect necessarily follows' (1677 Ethics I, axiom III) 
Additive interference 
Standard objection to free will 
Ned Hall: Causation is either difference making (Counterfactul dependence) or production 
physical (energy) transference, mechanism 
primitivism 
inferentialism (dilemma: all about thought (anti-realism) or about something in the world itself) 
Thomas Reid (1710-96): causation is something that can be seen directly; causation can be experienced, e.g. when you lift something, you fell a strain in your muscles, and you feel that it needs even more effort to succeed 
dispositionalism 
pandispositionalism: all properties are essentially dispositional in nature, e.g. things with sphericity will be disposed to behave in a certain way: to roll down a slope, for instance (pro: St. Thomas Aquinas; con: J. S. Mill, Russell, the logical positivists, Quine and Lewis) 
probability raising 
interventionist
