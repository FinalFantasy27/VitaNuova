type causality: smoking causes cancer
token / actual causality: the fact that Willard smoked for 30 years caused him to get cancer

Attempts to define causality go back to Aristotle
The modern view arguably dates back to Hume 1748
Relatively recent trend (going back to Lewis 1973) to capture actual causality using counterfactuals:
A is a cause of B if it is the case that if A had not happened, B would not have happened.
More recent trend: capture the counterfactuals using structural equations (Pearl 2000)
definiton of actual causality using structural equations:
original definiton: Halpern-Pearl, UAI 2001
improved (i.e., corrected): Halpern-Pearl, 2005 (BJPS)
yet another defintion: Halpern, 2015 (IJCAI)

problem: preemption [Lewis] Suzy and Billy

Structural equations
Random variables splitted into exogenous variables whose values are taken as given, determined by factors outside model and
endogenous variables.
Have an equation for each variable
Note that X=Y+U does not mean Y=X-U!
