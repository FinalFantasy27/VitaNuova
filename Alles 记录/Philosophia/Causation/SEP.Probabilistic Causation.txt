1.1 Problems for Regularity Theories
Attempts to analyze causation in terms of invariable patterns of succession are referred to as “regularity theories” of causation.

2.1 Probability-raising and Conditional Probability
P(E∣C)>P(E). alternatively P(E∣C)>P(E∣∼C);
Some authors (e.g., Reichenbach 1956, Suppes 1970, Cartwright 1979) have formulated probabilistic theories of causation using inequalities like PR1, others (e.g., Skyrms 1980, Eells 1991) have used inequalities like PR2. This difference is mostly immaterial
does not address the problem of asymmetry because probability-raising turns out to be symmetric: P(E∣C)>P(E∣∼C), if and only if P(C∣E)>P(C∣∼E).
 also has trouble with spurious correlations. If C and E are both caused by some third factor, A, then it may be that P(E∣C)>P(E∣∼C) even though C does not cause E.

where B ranges over the relevant background contexts. 

On the other hand, Eells’s population-relative formulation allows us to make more precise causal claims: in the population as a whole, smoking is a mixed cause of lung cancer; in the sub-population of individuals who lack the protective gene, smoking is a positive cause of lung cancer; in the sub-population consisting of individuals who possess the gene, smoking is a negative cause of lung cancer.

cases where causes seem to lower (or leave unchanged) the probabilities of their effects; and cases where non-causes seem to raise the probabilities of events that are not their effects
A number of authors have attempted to provide probabilistic analyses of actual causation. Some, such as Eells (1991: chapter 6), Kvart (1997, 2004), and Glynn (2011), pay careful attention to the way in which probabilities change over time. Some, such as Dowe (2004) and Schaffer (2001), combine probabilities with the resources of a process theory of causation. Some, such as Lewis (1986b) (‘probability-raising’ is not understood in terms of conditional probabilities, but in terms of unconditional probabilities in different possible worlds.; Interpolating an event into the sequence of events; has problems with other types of preemption, and with probability-raising non-causes), Menzies (1989), and Noordhof (1999), employ probabilities together with counterfactuals to analyze actual causation. And others such as Beckers & Vennekens (2016), Fenton-Glynn (2017), Halpern (2016: Section 2.5), Hitchcock (2004a), and Twardy & Korb (2011) employ causal modeling tools.
Glymour et al. (2010) raise a number of challenges to the general project of trying to provide an analysis of actual causation.
The anthologies Collins et al. 2004 and Dowe & Noordhof 2004 contain a number of essays on topics related to the discussion of this section. Hitchcock 2004b has an extended discussion of the problem posed by fizzlers.
