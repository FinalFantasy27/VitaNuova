To be Profound and to Appear Profound. He who knows that he is profound strives for clearness; he who would like to appear profound to the multitude strives for obscurity. The multitude thinks everything profound of which it cannot see the bottom; it is so timid and goes so unwillingly into the water.
Friedrich Nietzsche - The Gay Science
Book III - Aphorism # 173
