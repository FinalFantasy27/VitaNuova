有人说普特南是一个康德主义者；或者说，有一种对康德的诠释认为，康德是一个内在实在论者

““客体”、“表象”、“真理”、“知识”等概念只适用于我们的概念图式。人们通常把这种观点叫作“反实在论”或“内部实在论”，因为它拒绝实在论的“外部”立场，但它没有更强的观念论承诺（世界上的事物是“精神性的”或“依赖精神的”）。 ”

Putnam's internal realism
Putnam: 1976~1990

‘Truth’ … is some sort of (idealized) rational acceptability – some sort of ideal coherence of our beliefs with each other and with our experiences as those experiences are themselves represented in our belief system – and not correspondence with mind-independent or discourse-independent ‘states of affairs’. There is no God’s Eye point of view that we can know or usefully imagine; there are only the various points of view of actual persons reflecting various interests and purposes that their descriptions and theories subserve. (1981a: 49-50; italics in original)

The externalist (or Aristotelian/medieval/Kripkean essentialist) idea of selfidentifying objects makes no sense.7 Rather, “‘objects’ do not exist
independently of conceptual schemes. We cut up the world into objects when we introduce one or another scheme of description” (52). And there are multiple ways to do that “cutting up”: there are (at least sometimes) “equally coherent but incompatible conceptual schemes which fit our experience equally well” (73).

7 See also (1981b) and (1983a): “The idea … – i.e., that nature itself determines what our words stand for – is totally unintelligible. At bottom, to think that a sign-relation is built into nature is to revert to medieval essentialism, to the idea that there are ‘self-identifying objects’ and ‘species’ out there” (xii).

What makes a statement, or a whole system of statements – a theory or
conceptual scheme – rationally acceptable is, in large part its coherence and fit; coherence of “theoretical” of less experiential beliefs with one another and with more experiential beliefs, and also coherence of experiential beliefs with theoretical beliefs. (1981a: 54-5)
