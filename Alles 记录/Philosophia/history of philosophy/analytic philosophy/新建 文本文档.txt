艾柯曾评价奎因为“世界上最伟大的哲学家”
普特南曾经在多伦多开设马克思主义数学哲学的讲座
In 1990 we (Ned Block) had a great celebration for Quine in San Marino, “for the world’s greatest philosopher in the world’s oldest and smallertrepublic” Umberto Eco said.
Marxist philosophy of mathematics, as he presented it in a lecture in Toronto, turned out to be so very like Putnam’s earlier philosophy of mathematics.
