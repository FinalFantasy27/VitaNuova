For modal nominalism (Chihara), "number"s in mathematical statement are replaced by "numeral"s. If numerals are taken as types (patterns of inscription), then they are no help to nominalism. If they are taken as tokens, there may not be enough of them to make statements about infinity true. Modal nominalism introduces modal notions to address the issue.
