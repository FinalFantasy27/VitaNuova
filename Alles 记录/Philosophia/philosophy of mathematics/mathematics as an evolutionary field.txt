There are authors who believe mathematics is an evolutionary field, like [Jean-Pierre Changeux (Neural Materialism) in "Conversations on mind, matter, and mathematics"1, David Papineau in "Philosophical Naturalism", Penelope Maddy (maybe), Lakoff and Núñez in "Where Mathematics Comes From", Feng Ye, and Stanislas Dehaene in "The Number Sense: How the Mind Creates Mathematics", with discussion on the "unreasonable effectiveness of math".

1 a mathematical equation (such as that of Hodgkin and Huxley for the nerve impulse, for example) "describes a function. It allows us to grasp a certain behavior, but not to fully explain the phenomenon" (p. 60). An explanation would require the identification of the underlying structure (in thecase at hand, the biological structure of the channels for sodium and potassium ionsin the axon membrane) (p. 60).
