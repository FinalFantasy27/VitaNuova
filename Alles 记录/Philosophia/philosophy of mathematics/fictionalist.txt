Balaguer: If there are any such things as abstract objects, then they are causally inert. (1996a, 1998a)
Melia (2000) argues that we can assert our empirical theories and then simply take back the platonistic/mathematical consequences of those assertions. And Rosen (2001) argues that fictionalism is epistemically permissible because another community of scientists could accept the very same theories that we do while endorsing—or, more to the point, rationally endorsing—a fictionalist attitude toward the mathematical components of their theories. And Bueno (2009) argues that mathematics plays a descriptive role in empirical science, and because of this, it needn’t be true in order to be applicable. And Leng (2010) argues that the indispensability argument does not refute fictionalism because fictionalists can provide an adequate account of the success of science.
