罗杰·培根（约 1212-1292 年）认为地球是球形的，与天相比非常小。他还撰写了关于光、日食、潮汐、眼睛结构和视觉原理的文章。他在反射和折射方面的研究致力于了解如何使小的东西看起来大，远的东西看起来近。虽然他没有发明望远镜，但他确实发现了其他人用来发明望远镜的原理 (Opus Maius)。
(Roger Bacon (circa 1212–1292)) took the earth to be spherical and very small compared to the heavens. He also wrote about light, eclipses, tides, the structure of the eye, and the principles of vision. His work on reflection and refraction was devoted to learning how we could make small things appear large, and distant things near. Although he didn’t invent the telescope, he did discover principles that others would use to do so. (Opus Maius)

奥卡姆果断地否定了亚里士多德关于地面射弹的论述，而哲学家、物理学家、巴黎大学校长让·布里丹（卒于 1360 年）则否定了亚里士多德物理学，认为它无法解释旋转陀螺的运动。同样在巴黎任教的尼科尔·奥雷姆（卒于 1382 年）认为，地球自转的假设无法通过观察来推翻。
Ockham decisively rejected the Aristotelian account of terrestrial projectiles, while the philosopher, physicist, and rector of the University of Paris John Buridan (died 1360) rejected Aristotelian physics as being incapable of explaining the motion of a spinning top. Nicholas Oresme (died 1382), who also taught at Paris, argued that the hypothesis that the earth rotates can’t be disproved by observation, and, although he didn’t endorse the idea, he did suggest that there are some grounds for taking it to be true.
