Peter Lamarque argues that paraphrase encourages us to overlook 'the salience of verbal texture—sound, rhythm, rhyme' (2020, 88). The authors, however, contend that these elements are determinants of meaning, representing the speaker’s communicative intention. They assert that these elements hold evidential significance, or non-equivalently, they constitute 'the most reasonable conclusion concerning the speaker’s intention the hearer can draw in the circumstances,' but they are not constituents.
In response to Lepore (2009, 196), the authors maintain that 'poems are not about their own ordering of words—not always or even usually,' aligning their viewpoint with Lamarque (2015, 26).

Con 
While considering the notion of 'perspective' and its relation to cognition, Black Camp, in line with Camp's reflections (2006, 8), argue that perspective serves as a cognitive tool for thinking. They emphasize, however, that perspective itself is not thought, asserting that it 'does not impugn the paraphrase’s own adequacy.'
