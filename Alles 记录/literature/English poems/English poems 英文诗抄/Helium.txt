He is everywhere,
in the heavens and Earth.

He makes the stars shine,
yet He cannot be seen.

He is noble, abundant,
and fills the universe.

He can lift you into the sky,
and bring you gently down.

He can take many forms.

He can help heal,
He can help kill.

He can help create,
He can help destroy.

Praise be unto He.
Helium.
