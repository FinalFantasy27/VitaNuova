The Gambler sang by Kenny Rogers 
Song by Don Schlitz

On a warm summer's evening
On a train bound for nowhere
I met up with the gambler
We were both too tired to sleep
So we took turns a-starin'
Out the window at the darkness
The boredom overtook us
And he began to speak
He said, "Son, I've made a life
Out of readin' people's faces
Knowin' what the cards were
By the way they held their eyes
So if you don't mind my sayin'
I can see you're out of aces
For a taste of your whiskey
I'll give you some advice"
So I handed him my bottle
And he drank down my last swallow
Then he bummed a cigarette
And asked me for a light
And the night got deathly quiet
And his face lost all expression
Said, "If you're gonna play the game, boy
You gotta learn to play it right
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
Every gambler knows
That the secret to survivin'
Is knowin' what to throw away
And knowin' what to keep
'Cause every hand's a winner
And every hand's a loser
And the best that you can hope for
Is to die in your sleep"
And when he'd finished speakin'
He turned back toward the window
Crushed out his cigarette
Faded off to sleep
And somewhere in the darkness
The gambler he broke even
But in his final words
I found an ace that I could keep
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
You've got to know when to hold 'em (when to hold 'em)
Know when to fold 'em (when to fold 'em)
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done
You've got to know when to hold 'em
Know when to fold 'em
Know when to walk away
And know when to run
You never count your money
When you're sittin' at the table
There'll be time enough for countin'
When the dealin's done

唐·施利茨 (Don Schlitz) 于 1976 年 8 月创作了这首歌，当时他 23 岁。
在Shel Silverstein的催促下，Bobby Bare在他的专辑Bare中录制了这首歌之前，花了两年时间在纳什维尔附近售卖这首歌。Bare 的版本没有流行起来，也从未作为单曲发行过，所以 Schlitz 自己录制了它，但那个版本在美国乡村音乐排行榜上未能超过第 65 位。Johnny Cash也注意到这首朗朗上口的歌曲并在 1978 年录制了这首歌，收录在他的专辑Gone Girl 中。 
这些歌手并没有让这首歌曲流行起来。最终，肯尼·罗杰斯（ Kenny Rogers）于 1978 年 11 月将这首歌作为他的专辑The Gambler的主打曲目发行。肯尼·罗杰斯演唱的版本使这首歌很快流行了起来，在流行音乐榜（the pop chart）的乡村歌曲分类中名列第一（在当时，乡村歌曲很少出现的时候进入了流行音乐榜）。The Gambler专辑也使肯尼·罗杰斯赢得了1980 年格莱美最佳乡村男声表演奖。 
2006 年，唐·施利茨（Don Schlitz） 出现在 肯尼·罗杰斯（Kenny Rogers ）的职业回顾纪录片“The Journey”中，他赞扬了罗杰斯和制作人拉里巴特勒对这首歌的贡献，称“他们添加了一些不属于我的想法，比如新的吉他前奏”.（ "They added several ideas that were not mine, including the new guitar intro."）
