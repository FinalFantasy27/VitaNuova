In 1799, Paolo Ruffini proved that there was no general solution using radicals for polynomial equations of degree 5 or more. But his proof was 500 pages long!  And his argument seems to have a gap… and

later Niels Abel gave a proof that was just 6 pages long

Galois invented group theory. He showed a bunch of specific polynomial equations couldn’t be solved just using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking roots. For example, those operations aren’t powerful enough to solve this equation:

x^5 - x + 1 = 0

while they can solve this one:

x^5 - x = 0

the longest proof written up in journals is the classification of finite simple groups

This was done by lots of people in lots of papers, and the total length is somewhere between 10,000 and 20,000 pages… People are trying to simplify it and rewrite it. The new proof will be a mere 5,000 pages long. So far six books have been written as part of this project.

mathematicians led by George Gonthier have used Coq to give a completely detailed proof of a small piece of the classification of finite simple groups: the Feit–Thompson Theorem.

Feit and Thompson’s original proof of this result, skipping lots of steps that are obvious to experts, took 255 pages

Galois showed that every polynomial equation has a group of symmetries, and you can solve the equation using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking roots if its group has a certain special property. This property of a group got the name ‘solvability’.

Every finite group with an odd number of elements is solvable. Its formal proof took them 6 years! The completed computer proof has 170,000 lines. It involves 15,000 definitions and 4,300 lemmas.
