Thomas Hales seems to have proved that the densest packing of spheres in 3d space is the obvious one

Hales’ proof is a hundred pages of writing together with about 3 gigabytes of computer calculations. If we wrote out those calculations in a text file, they’d fill about 2 million pages!
The method is called ‘proof by exhaustion’, because it involves reducing the problem to 10,000 special cases and then settling each one with detailed calculations…
Hales has done a fully formal proof that can be verified by automated proof checking software such as HOL.
